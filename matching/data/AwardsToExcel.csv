An alternative to the complex and costly UAV model is a new paradigm employing multiple small or mini-UAVs that operate in virtual swarms to achieve the complex objectives of today's reconnaissance missions. The advantage of this UAV swarm approach is clearly in the overall cost increased redundancy and a drastic reduction in single points of failure. The challenge is to develop swarming behaviors that can cope with the difficult conditions of combat. The team of 21st Century Systems Inc. and the University of Nebraska Omaha propose researching a concept called Co-Operative Multi-agent Automated Target Recognition UAVs (COMSTAR-UAV) to take advantage of advances in multi-agent system software ands the latest sensor and processing capabilities. The COMSTAR-UAV concept will be able to scale up efficiently in the number of UAVs deployed and in the amount of data collected and processed.

But as Operation Iraqi Freedom recently showed foreign militaries have equipment to locally jam GPS signals. Another effective method of autonomous navigation is necessary to ensure mission success. Similar to rudimentary terrain recognition used in early cruise missiles the matching of terrain video images with onboard digitized terrain information can be used to accurately provide a platform with effective positional awareness. The team of 21st Century Systems Inc. and the University of Nebraska at Omaha is pleased to address the first step in achieving this worthy goal. Our proposed research focuses on developing a mathematically sound approach for image similarity detection and extraction.  The project is aimed at the development of a methodology that is suitable for various military weapon system applications such as target identification and autonomous navigation of unmanned vehicles.  The method is based on the Eigen-similarity of a set of image features. We call this concept the Eigen-Similarity Integral (ESI). The advantages of an ESI-based method for comparing and matching the dominant components of images include computation effectiveness uniqueness flexibility and conciseness.  The ability to perform a computationally effective comparison of real-time images with images or video from a library is a key enabling technology for many military and commercial activities. Militarily speaking this capability could be used for automated target recognition automated target tracking and autonomous navigation for unmanned weapon systems. Certainly a navigation or targeting system based solely on GPS is neither robust nor fault-tolerant. An ESI-based navigation system would provide that advantage. An ESI-based software application would accelerate the exploitation of intelligence and UAV camera imagery and ground moving target indicator (GMTI) video. Using the ESI-based image discerning capability of GMTI video contextual map data and intelligent agents this application of our research could assist with target recognition target tracking and detection through clutter (i.e. trees). Many non-military applications involving video monitoring would benefit strongly from the core concept: facility and physical security traffic monitoring and others. Indeed the Homeland Defense arena could make excellent use of the results of this research.","F033-0122","AF03T008","03  ",

Otto applies innovative research and techniques in order to yield a visual-based navigation capability for station keeping and approach to landing. Our concept uses video input to guide an unmanned aircraft through an approach pattern and provide a constant-glideslope descent to the touchdown point. It requires no powered equipment on the ground and works with any existing UAV that has a camera capable of facing forward on approach. No changes are required on the aircraft as the Otto concept is a software upgrade required in the Ground Control Station only.

(21CT) presents the Human and Unmanned Teaming for Tracking Elusive Dismounts (HUNTED) effort. HUNTED gives small units direct control over a coordinated team of two or more unmanned systems (UMS) to perform superior search detection and tracking of elusive pedestrian targets in an urban environment. Our novel approach combines 3D environment knowledge with a unique non-linear target behavior prediction method. HUNTED applies the game theory tenant that the target’s behavior can be actively shaped by the pursuer’s behavior and provides a novel solution to the problem that achieves superior operational performance with lower operator workload. Using our approach HUNTED proactively places collaborating UMSs to cover each other’s blind spots cooperatively hunt a target instead of merely tracking it and corral and drive the target towards a desired location. This enables teams of UMSs to succeed in tracking tasks at which a single UMS would fail. By doing so HUNTED will surpass the operational performance of today’s approaches to tracking elusive pedestrian targets in urban areas.  HUNTED Phase 2 culminates in a staged field demonstration where ACR Silver Fox™ UAVs fly HUNTED-computed goals and flight paths to demonstrate a superior ability to maintain eyes on target.","O2-0712","OSD06-UM2","06.3",

For UAV platform routing current point-to-point routing techniques are not sufficient. New techniques must be developed that allow UAVs to autonomously generate and update routes during flight dynamically.  The control strategy must therefore automate or self-manage as much of the low- and mid-level planning as possible to reduce the operator workload and provide coordination at the mission level to ensure that mission objectives are accomplished. To address this challenge 3 Phoenix Inc. and the Applied Research Laboratory / Pennsylvania State University have teamed to develop dynamic routing and multi-objective scheduling algorithms for implementation within a standards-based real-time data fusion and intelligent control C4ISR architecture. This two-tier approach will simultaneously reduce operator workload and increase fleet efficiency by enabling UAVs to autonomously plan their routes in accordance with the current tactical picture.

We propose a combined effort of theoretical and experimental studies to be fully responsive to the need of the SWARM program. Accurate Automation Corporation (AAC) offers a comprehensive approach to design and manufacture a propeller that reduces the noise by 12dBA with respect to the commercially available propeller for similar thrust requirements. There is an uncompromising need for quiet operation of the UAVs to minimize detection by listening devices.  The noise generated by a propeller must be lowered to make it consistent with the remaining components such as exhaust of a propulsion system.  AAC is uniquely positioned to expand the propeller design experience gained during the Gun Launched Observation Vehicle program under Navy (NSWC) supervision. As an optional task we offer to conduct extensive testing and refinement of our propeller.   During the follow-on phases AAC proposes to study the acoustic noise suppression due to unsteady pressures generated by propeller blade vibrations.  Shunted piezoelectric actuators strategically embedded in the blades will be considered for blade vibration suppression in the Phase II and III of this program. AAC has an outstanding record in the UAV development arena.  We have integrated from propellers to small turbo-jet engines in our UAVs.   The quiet propeller is a critical component for our future platforms.  We are investing Venture Capital funds to supplement the tasks required to perform on this project in a time and cost constrained manner.

The laser comprises a hybrid system in which a directly modulated 1064nm semiconductor laser is amplified in a multistage Yb-doped fiber amplifier and subsequently frequency doubled in non-critically phase match LBO crystal. In the phase I program all key specifications will be demonstrated in a laboratory breadboard. We will demonstrate >10W output power at or around 532nm with pulse durations in the range 0.5-5.0ns and pulse repetition frequencies (PRF) in the range 100kHz-10MHz. The proposed architecture which overcomes the PRF size weight and efficiency limitations of current laser technologies  is ideally suited to the requirements of the solicitation and to the targeted deployment environment. In a phase I option we will operate our seed laser in a single frequency regime as required by the primary application. The option experiments will enable us to bridge the phase I demonstration to a phase II deliverable with minimal difficulty. The Yb fiber amplifier at the heart of the system is based around an established pulsed fiber laser product platform which will form the basis of the packaged laser delivered by Aculight in the event of a phase II award.  BENEFITS: High power lasers have many potential applications in DOD systems.  The proposed application for underwater communication represents a significant opportunity for Aculight.  With the rapid increase in UAVs and UUVs and the corresponding requirements for compact efficient and lightweight laser sources we see the potential for an important and sizeable market.  In addition to communications Navy missions such as mine detection and other optical technologies that utilize blue-green lasers could also benefit from the development of the laser system. Aculight’s business philosophy is to target dual-use technologies that have both military and volume commercial applications.  The proposed high power green laser combining high power and high brightness with low signal noise at high repetition rates has a great potential to replace existing mode-locked DPSS lasers and directly modulated LDs for medical material processing and defense applications such as micromachining marking and semiconductor processing.

Essential to enabling these vehicles is a wing skin that is highly compliant in-plane for wing morphing while being highly stiff out-of-plane to carry aerodynamic loads. Shape memory polymers show substantial promise in meeting these conflicting requirements by allowing for dramatic changes in the material’s elastic modulus through the use of heat.  However critical to their application for morphing wing skins is efficient heat transfer enabling actuation of the wing skin within a timeframe that is consistent with vehicle flight control needs. Unfortunately resistive heating methods traditionally used for shape memory polymers have thus far proven unable to meet this actuation rate requirement. As a result the United States Air Force has significant interest in developing material for morphing wing skins that meets this actuation rate requirement. To address this need ADA Technologies Inc. proposes a multidisciplinary program that will result in novel means to achieve volumetric heating of the SMP morphing wing skin through electromagnetic induction.  BENEFIT:  The proposed program will result in shape memory polymer morphing skins that are characterized by unprecedented improvements in heating rate and magnitude with triggering hardware that is lightweight and low in volume. The results of the proposed program will allow for novel flight control as well as broadening the mission profile of future air vehicles. Furthermore the developments undertaken will substantially improve the state-of-the-art of adaptive materials. Thus if successful the resulting technology could have substantial commercial impact as the overall market for unmanned air systems (UASs) is estimated to be in excess of billions per year. Spin-off applications include commercial applications of morphing wing skins for UASs such as gun and/or hand-launched unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) that range in size from 10 to 5000 lbs.","F093-127-0594","AF093-127","09.3",

Traditional approaches have focused on harvesting solar and vibration (i.e. via the use of piezoelectric materials) energy. More recently substantial interest has developed in harvesting energy derived from thermal gradients (e.g. due to solar radiation and/or waste heat) as it has the potential to greatly surpass the power generation capabilities of more traditional approaches. Unfortunately deficiencies in performance high process costs manufacturing toxicity and durability of state-of-the-art ceramic-based thermoelectric (TE) materials have prevented their widespread adoption. To address these needs ADA Technologies Inc. in collaboration with the University of Colorado propose the development of a novel durable high performance and highly scalable thermoelectric material based on polymer nanocomposites.  BENEFIT:  Energy harvesting and conversion are critical needs of numerous military applications. For example future high altitude unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and micro air vehicles (MAVs) possess an acute need for lightweight energy generation systems due to their relatively small size that severely restricts their on-board power systems. Further wireless aircraft health monitoring systems are only feasible using an energy harvesting system such as a thermoelectric generator. High performance energy harvesting systems would also be attractive to dismounted soldiers and airmen to reduce their energy storage device mass burden and thus significantly enhance their safety. The utilization of low-temperature thermoelectric generators in conjunction with higher efficiency energy storage devices is anticipated to lead to dramatic weight reductions and increase the soldier payload capabilities. Potential commercial uses of low-temperature thermoelectrics include structural health monitors for wind turbine blades and civil infrastructure automobile passenger comfort equipment and numerous applications in consumer electronics.","F2-6657","AF10-BT26","10.B",

Recovering such vehicles safely and accurately is an obvious requirement. A very limited payload capacity however limits options for guidance equipment required for precision recovery. Modern battlefields further require ability to operate in a GPS-denied environment and without jamming-prone RF communication. Adsys Controls proposes a novel optical guidance system providing precision approach path guidance (a/c position and range) through touchdown.  The system is specifically designed for accuracy small size and ease of use while providing day/night all-weather operability. Adaptability for different vehicle recovery methods as well as support for multi-vehicle operations provides a robust method for flexible battlefield operations.  BENEFIT:  The autolanding capability provided will simplify UAS operations expand their operating envelope and reduce cost. In the end this will increase usage of UAS by the DoD law enforcement fire protection and research organizations. There are other applications outside of UAS where the technology can provide benefits.

These small devices can each generate nearly 60 pounds of force from energy scavenged from vibration and several powered designs will be prepared in Phase I to test the best concept for fracturing ice. A test stand will be constructed using a rotor section. The most likely candidate designs will be made into self-powered units in Phase II.

While the IR spectrum contains thermal information about the flame the UV portion of the spectrum contains information about the gas chemistry that is usually not affected by reflections - leading to a high signal to noise ratio.    The proposed effort extends existing spectral analysis work in the visible and IR to observe the spectra in the UV.  An extensive data base of different muzzle flashes and projectiles will be established from which key aspects of the spectra will be determined to enable future rapid assessment of the muzzle flash.  Following the initial assessment of a wide range of spectra a rapid computed tomography imaging spectrometer will be integrated onto the Silver Fox UAV for airborne reconnaissance and assessment of muzzle flashes.  The outcome of the proposed effort will be a local airborne surveillance system that can provide rapid assessment of muzzle flashes thereby discriminating between friend or foe.

Development of passivated mandrel coating allows electroforming of an optical quality surface while stress free electroforming provides a stable element which retains its shape.  In Phase I we demonstrated by actual hardware prototyping:  a quality optical parabolic reflector in a spherical ball; a smoothly moving and stable ball and socket mechanical motion; and an ultra light weight ball and socket with an optical surface in the ball.  We demonstrated by detailed computer ray tracing the feasibility of:  lightweight Fresnel optics on a spherical surface a Cassegrain telescope in the eyeball geometry; and a sidelooking geometry with all active elements off gimbal.

An inter-turbine burner is a second combustor placed between the gas generator exit and the power turbine to "reheat" the engine gas stream before it enters the power turbine. The inter-turbine burner is used to increase engine power at the maximum power setting permitting the core engine to be run closer to its design condition at part power settings.  Cycle analysis shows significant improvement in engine power with an accompanying increase in specific fuel consumption at the full power condition.  The part power specific fuel consumption improves by significant at power levels below half of the maximum power. This improve specific fuel consumption at part power settings will reduce fuel consumption during the cruise/loiter segments of the UAV mission. Thus there is a net benefit to time-on-station provided that the cruise/loiter segment is long compared to the take-off and climb segments.

All pistons are connected to a single crankshaft located between the two opposed cylinders by unconventional (long=low friction) connecting rods. Intake and Exhaust ports are located at the ends of the cylinder. These ports provide the necessary uniflow cylinder scavenging (there are no valves or camshafts). The crankshaft journals which control the position of the pistons are arranged asymmetrically such that for each cylinder the exhaust ports open before the intake ports and close before the intake ports. This asymmetric timing is a must and provides for proper exhaust-blow-down and allows intake supercharging.    The two-stroke engine has been eliminated by many as a viable future technology despite its superior efficiency and power density essentially because of its scavenging problems. The engineering community needs to see proof-of-concept with the OPOC technology to change their minds on the two-stroke engine.    The OPOC engine will eliminate current unsolved two-cycle problems such as lack of precise scavenging and improve upon two-cycle engine benefits in the areas of efficiency size very low vibration and cost. This project will be the initial phase of a process leading to commercialization of the exceptional two-cycle OPOC engine. Through this project we aim to make transparent the advantages of the OPOC engine technology over currently know four-cycle engines.    The potential markets for the generic OPOC engine design are virtually all of the combustion engines for commercial or military sectors. The OPOC engine will reduce OEM costs since it has less than 60% engine parts compared to the short block and cylinder head of a conventional 4-cylinder in-line engine. Moreover because of the OPOC engine's significantly smaller packaging dimensions and because the OPOC engine is vibration free it has improved installation suitability allowing further reduction in manufacturing costs. The application possibilities for the OPOC engine range from cars to off-road vehicles unmanned vehicles and light aircraft.    We at Advanced Propulsion Technologies Inc. feel that military and commercial sources will use the OPOC engine in at least one application within five years. Once commercialized other applications and successes will follow.","D022-0241","SB022-050","02.2",

The LOLIPOP system consists a series of very high-speed near-infrared (NIR) Deformable Mirror Device (DMD) projectors providing overlapping volumetric views. Each projector is driven with a sequence of binary images which encode the position of each pixel within the sensor image. Each entity is equipped with a set of high-speed IR sensors to receive the pixel position information within the overlapping projection area. These are then relayed to the tracking system which triangulates the 3D position of the view within the operating volume. The low latency projectors may be reprogrammed at high speed while projecting allowing the patterns and coverage of the projectors to adapt on the fly to occlusion sensor density and required sampling rate.","A101-023-0635","A10-023","10.1",

In Phase I ATEI and the University of Minnesota focused efforts on application research to establish key performance parameters such as phase noise phase shifter resolution/accuracy linear dynamic range channel isolation etc. and analyze the feasibility of the proposed integration scheme and RF/mixed signal circuits that will result in revolutionary capabilities or superior performance which cannot be achieved by current III-V technologies.  Simulation and/or basic experiments expected RF performance integration level (RF and digital transistor counts) and required integration technologies (3D integration etc.) of the proposed circuits was presented and discussed including proposed realistic fabrication technologies or necessary technology developments to realize the target RF/mixed signal circuits for the next phases. The results from our research proved the feasibility that highly integrated Si-based RF electronics and infrastructure to can be deployed in small form factor low power and with superior capability and performance than modern phased-array and other traditional radars. In Phase II ATEI and the University of Minnesota will design and test Silicon CMOS prototypes which would enable the realization of large-element or wafer scale MIMO radar. The principal blocks would involve the RF front-end for the receiver the transmitter’s RF section and the MIMO DSP. The linearity of the RF blocks (especially those of the front-end) plays a critical role in determining the capacity of multi-target detection and resolution – the end-metric for any radar. The end-product of this work would be a single-chip CMOS design consisting of separate transmits and receive sections each consisting of their respective RF and baseband sub-sections. Eventually there has to be a central DSP which would run the MIMO algorithm on all the accumulated data but some level of DSP which can be done at the individual element level (like out-of-band filtering) would be integrated into the single CMOS chip. In phase II digital-to-analog and analog-to digital conversions will be performed off-chip using test equipment. IF / baseband transmit waveforms and receive signal processing will be performed using a combination of algorithms develop in MATLAB and SIMULINK. ","D2-0811","SB082-044","08.2",

The control system must feature the ability to adaptively respond to losses during the mission such that degraded communications or destruction of aircraft generate new allocations of responsibilities among mission members.  A control system backbone in the form of a hierarchical organizational structure of agent control modules simultaneously executing many layers of control and planning in real-time will be created. This will be accomplished by applying an advanced control system concept called RCS (Real-time Control System) to the task of coordinated control of multiple unmanned air vehicles (UAVs).  This organizational structure can carry out cooperative autonomous behavior in large groups of UAVs in various tactical situations.   This control system will exhibit varying autonomous capabilities such as regrouping with losses reallocation of resources and reordering of priorities while carrying out a variety of mission assignments including reconnaissance searching tracking relay communications target identification and navigational guidance. Autonomous vehicles including land vehicles aircraft and undersea vehicles have demonstrated many advantages over manned vehicles.  Complex tasks have been performed either by remotely piloted vehicles with a person executing the control or with the vehicle executing some tasks using an automated control system without full time human insertion.  The complexity of the vehicles is moving in two developmental axes simultaneously: viz. the addition of more complexity to the vehicle as evidenced by larger and more integrated sensor suites and the addition of more vehicles to form ensembles of vehicles operating simultaneously.  This task addresses the needs to move into the multiple simultaneous autonomous vehicle operational scenario.  While the starting point of design is a relatively simple individual vehicle operating in an ensemble this scenario can be extended into groups of more complex vehicles.  The opportunity presents itself then for scalable ensembles of vehicles ranging from low unit cost vehicles to higher unit cost vehicles all operating on a control system that is easily reconfigurable as the mission and the vehicle changes.  The concept is not unique to the military but could be quite interesting to any organization interested in large area survey such as natural mineral survey.  ","N021-1175","N02-097","02.1",

These miniature LADAR sensors would have far reaching impact on a number of DoD applications because of their dramatic reduction in cost significantly smaller size weight and power (SWaP) and their improved performance regarding sensitivity and frame rate. The CMOS FPA will integrate in one chip hundreds of photonic components and about one million transistors making it one of the largest electronic-photonic integrated circuits ever fabricated. In Phase I Aerius will design all the elements of the integrated chip and will test some individual components. This work will evaluate integration feasibility and reduce the risk for further development. Also in Phase I Aerius will define the commercialization plan to guide action in Phase II and Phase III of the program. In Phase II Aerius will fabricate a prototype FPA to demonstrate the significant functionality improvements targeted. The resulting high performance FPA prototypes will be provided to system integrators for incorporation into systems that benefit the mission of DoD and that will be transitioned into manufacturing in Phase III.

Our proposal for TV2 (Targeting Video from VIVID) ties together these assets ever more effectively.  TV2 remaps UAV target imagery into targeting imagery as will be seen from the F18’s targeting pod.  This speeds F18 visual cueing and target confirmation.   Aerodyne’s innovative approach side-steps need for online signature code computations enabling TV2 real-time execution on COTS hardware yet producing high-fidelity imagery.  Two key modules comprise TV2.  (1) View extrapolation involving inference of target geometry represents view-dependent illumination and shadowing effects not possible from image-warping or conventional IBR. (2) Atmospheric correction employs pre-computed physics correcting color balance and saturation loss without needing non-portable hardware acceleration.   Our Phase 1 effort will confirm the TV2 and transit case processor (TCP) ConOps with NAVAIR. Employing focused algorithm prototyping and testing we will determine the best candidate view extrapolation algorithm and validate our pre-computed atmospheric correction scheme all using efficient tools and methodologies in-hand.  In Phase 2 we will fully implement and integrate TV2 with the VIVID algorithms on the TCP.  The delivered TCP will be ready for Phase 3 T&E demonstration and subsequent operational transition.

The proposed vehicle is a modified oblate spheroid giving a high package volume with fuel capacity for hover duration of an hour or a cruise range  of about 40 km at an air speed of 70 km/hr.  Its characteristics derive directly from propulsion and power generation capabilities inherent in microturbine technology under development at MIT.  Thrust from multiple microturbofans is used directly for propulsion with vehicle attitude maneuver and hover control implemented via valving of fan bleed air.  The result is a High Performance Aerial Vehicle (HIPERAV) carrying a large interchangeable instrument package incorporating sensor data transmitter and mission/vehicle control functions.  Electrical power is taken from the propulsion turbines providing high power for data transmission.  Thisimplies both a high data rate capability and potential for satellite interfacing.

The current state-of-the-art uses various types of honeycomb materials with glass and composite face sheets that are expensive to fabricate. Current replicated mirror technologies do not meet the stringent performance parameters of both light weight and surface quality. Nanolaminates pucker locally when bonded to SiC and stretched shell mirrors cannot maintain their shape without significant supporting structures. The results are structurally inefficient mirror systems that cost and weigh too much.  The proposed program will develop low cost manufacturing methods for reflective films supported by a structural network of lightweight nanotubes. The Replicated Nanotube Reflector (RNR) uses a low cost sputtered film rather than a nanolaminate and a low cost mixed grade of nanotubes as a supporting structure. Testing has already shown that this combination can produce a surface roughness of only 8.1Å exceeding the stated &#955;/500 goal.   ABS will develop the RNR system through a careful plan of technology transfer design modeling and prototype manufacture and testing. Complete development of this technology will provide a mirror system that will enable better lighter and less expensive optical instruments.    BENEFIT:  In addition to the myriad of Air Force Missile Defense Agency NASA and other government missions such as ABL SBL and observation platforms that would take advantage of extremely stiff and lightweight mirrors many university and private observatories would be ready customers of the RNR mirror technology.  UAV’s in particular use both curved focusing mirrors and flat steering mirrors to rapidly image over tactical battlespaces. ABS commercialization partner QinetiQ is the developer of the Zephyr. This extremely high altitude UAV is very payload weight limited and would benefit greatly from a low cost lightweight set of concentrating and steering mirrors.

The concept of structurally-integrated multifunction antennae embedded into airframes is central to the DoD’s "smart skins" technology initiative offering many significant and obvious benefits over conventional antennae that include reduced weight aerodynamic drag and radar cross-section as well as increased air vehicle and antenna system performance.  However realizing the full potential of integrated antenna systems in small UAVs requires design tools that support 1) the concurrent development of airframe configuration geometry and antenna system architecture and 2) the detail design of load-bearing antenna structures.  To meet this challenge Aerotonomy and GTRI have developed a unique two-stage Multi-Disciplinary Optimization system that meets the needs of both configuration and detail design optimization.  The system incorporates the latest knowledge in conformal load-bearing antenna design structural and electromagnetic modeling and optimization techniques.","F2-3217","AF05-T019","05  ",

In addition the AU-DSA design incorporates a compact flexible state-of-the-art avionics system and an intuitive interface for communications with operators ATC and other pilots in order to provide the complete range of functionalities needed for a UAS to operate safely and autonomously in the NAS. The main goal of this work is to develop and demonstrate the systems necessary to equip small UAVs with a collision avoidance system capable of autonomously complying with federally mandated regulations.

This investigation found that turbulent loads are the driving factor in the design of these vehicles.  In particular two-or three dimensional turbulent motions give rise to higher loads that those from the maneuvering or one-dimensional gust loads used in classical aircraft design.  Existing turbulent loads analysis techniques and data were found to be inadequate when trying to estimate the design loads for such flexible and lightweight aircraft.  It was also found that almost no statistical turbulence data exists for aircraft that cruise for months at extreme altitudes and may experience only one or two takeoffs and landings during their design lifetime.  As a result the current generation of aircraft may have been significantly over-designed to account for uncertainty in the expected turbulence loads.

Batteries are expensive and provide limited flight duration. A viable alternative to batteries that could provide higher gravimetric and volumetric energy density and lower life cycle cost are hybrid battery/fuel cell systems with hydrogen stored as chemical hydride which when reacted with water generates the required fuel as-needed. AeroVironment’s (AV’s) Phase I effort determined it would be feasible to develop an integrated fuel cell/battery hybrid energy storage system for the AV-designed and manufactured PUMA UAV The 9-ft wingspan PUMA has a flight duration of three hours on rechargeable batteries but will be able to fly for 6-8 hours with the fuel cell-based energy storage system.  In phase I we worked with several fuel cell system developers and conducted a bench top demonstration of an integrated fuel cell/battery hybrid system using a Protonex fuel cell and hydrogen storage system. In Phase II we will optimize and build a fuel cell-based energy storage system and conduct several tests to demonstrate achievable flight duration. We will also perform feasibility studies for adding advanced solar cells on the PUMA wings and integrating a similar energy storage system into the Raven UAV.","F2-3337","AF06-180","06.1",

The development of sensing technology has focused primarily on the extension of the sense of sight e.g. the use of radar infrared E/O and laser technologies; while relatively little effort has been invested in the extension of the sense of hearing. But merely adding acoustic sensor systems to exploit sound would only add to the information overload problem with possibly little value-added no matter how good the fundamental sensor technology is. This proposed effort would allow the Air Force to incorporate information from advanced airborne acoustic sensors into its ISR and weapon systems without aggravating the data overload problem. The key to this effort is successful automated sound recognition technology under widely varying conditions. A combination of learning machine techniques and physics-based adaptive environmental acoustics will be used to solve this problem. Technology developed in the field of underwater acoustics for submarine detection and recent developments in air-acoustics for enhanced situational awareness in urban operations are highly leveraged in this effort.

Two technologies considered significant to meet the emerging UAV requirements include power extraction and the engine centrifugal compressor material. Therefore two studies will be conducted in the proposed program:    ·	A detailed study will be conducted to evaluate secondary power extraction propulsion system optimization: Trading design integration of propulsion engine and electric power generator for efficiency space and weight to provide an affordable operable weapon system with adequate range.  Primary focus will be on the design integration of said electric power generator with the aircraft engine Fan/LPC in order in order to minimize installed volume/weight preserving engine performance operability and fuel burn for range and providing an affordable systems solution.    ·	As an option a second study with relatively lower amount of effort will be conducted to analyze the impeller design and its operating environment in order to be able to select a viable centrifugal compressor material to meet the emerging UAV engine operating life and reliability.     Honeywell the largest producer of small gas turbine engines strongly supports this effort and will be assisting Agilis with the information required to successfully complete this study. With the need for increased power generation for aircraft/ propulsion secondary power a study is needed that will provide an analysis of potential locations to place an electrical generator in the engine area.  Proper selection and location of the generator will minimize installed volume/weight preserving engine performance operability and fuel burn for range and providing an affordable systems solution.    A higher temperature material for turbine engine centrifugal compressor (impeller) will enable higher rotor speeds and increased engine thrust in addition to improving reliability decreasing mission abort rates reducing maintenance and repair costs and therefore reducing the cost of ownership of the aircraft.  Propulsion contributes up to 45% of the Life Cycle Cost of the weapon system.  Small increases in performance and durability have significant impacts on the overall weapon system cost.

The SiGe digital imaging sensor consists of a Si-based CMOS imaging sensor with monolithically integrated SiGe photodiodes to extend the cutoff wavelength deep into the SWIR. By introducing SWIR capability to the mature CMOS imaging technology we uniquely exploit the advantages each technology offers to realize a digital imaging sensor for night vision applications with unprecedented functionality and low cost. In Phase II we will fabricate four prototype SiGe digital imaging sensors including at least one with an integrated microdisplay that will be delivered to the Air Force for incorporation into a relevant night vision system platform.  BENEFIT: The SiGe digital imaging sensors are ideally suited for replacement of image intensifier tubes in night vision goggles and devices. Traditional applications of these devices include night vision surveillance and passive imaging since they will allow detection in complete darkness and in harsh conditions. Moreover the extended spectral coverage of the SiGe digitial imaging sensors beyond 2.0 µm opens up new applications in covert imaging heretofore impossible with legacy SWIR imagers. The SiGe digital imaging sensors will also be critical in supporting military operations in modern urban and cave warfare either as standalone sensors or in combination with MWIR and LWIR sensors. The radical cost reduction will make it possible to equip every soldier and every vehicle with an imaging camera. The compact size and low power consumption will make the cameras well-suited for UAVs and other remote applications. Other applications of the SiGe digital imaging sensors include covert illumination range gated imaging free space communications hyperspectral imaging and wavefront sensing tracking and ranging for missile threat warning systems.","F2-4846","AF081-007","08.1",

Although LASARST can also be used with LPD class vessels and small land based recovery areas it is designed specifically for those vessels that have too small a deck area to capture the UAV in the `conventional' or current method (i.e. SPARS).  Where it differs radically from the present system is that it provides a much greater area of capture with a greatly reduced footprint from the present SPARS and is automatically self deploying. Therefore it can be mounted on much smaller vessels and can yet capture UAVs that at present are not considered possible solutions to Naval and Marine Operations. LASARS can open up UAV operations to vessels such as DDG Class Guided Missile Destroyers (66ft Beam width) and FFG Class Frigates (45ft Beam width) which presently have insufficient beam width at the aft end for SPARS recovery of a 450-500lb UAV landing at speeds up to 70mph.   At the completion of Phase I airBeams LLC will have a preliminary system design and model completed of a conceptual LASARSTM.  In Phase II airBeams LLC will refine the design and model to a point where it can be utilized as the basis for a model LASARST for testing.  The prime commercialization prospect is the UAV user community (DOD DEA INS Department of Homeland Security etc.) in particular the US DOD.  UAVs are now being used for many civilian applications from photography to seismic soundings for oil companies. Most usually the latter in particular operate with small drones from rough territory or from the sea and they do not have the luxury of LPD Class vessels on which to land the UAV. The potential commercial market will expand considerably as the sophistication and reliability of the UAVs is improved because of the military requirements. This will drive down costs increasing the potential market for LASARST.","N031-2315","N03-058","03.1",

They travel along the missile's axial plane coupled through a common pinion gear.     Advanced features such as independent control of each fin dynamic preloading to reduce vibration and increase precision and air breaking to control velocity can be implemented via this approach. The design provides inherent fault tolerant capability allowing continued system operation via graceful degradation and is unaffected by vehicle acceleration due to the symmetrically applied forces of the dual actuator design.  Integral thermal monitoring allows the control system to dynamically allocate power for peak steering performance in critical mission segments. Inherent position feedback allows precise fin angle position accuracy during all operating situations despite applied stresses.

Currently MH-60K and MH-47E aircraft use a multi mode radar (MMR) to navigate and avoid ground hazards.  Such active systems are detectable by passive observers.  Helicopters can avoid the use of active systems through the use of Passive Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (Passive TF/TA).  This technique also has the potential to lower the overall altitude of such flights and give the pilots considerable situational awareness.  The technology now exists to develop such systems.  ALPHATECH proposes to develop and demonstrate algorithms for Passive Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance.  The algorithms will be specifically designed to handle the problems of bias and error peculiar to terrain estimation and will be based on multiresolution statistical models.  This approach has several advantages including the versatility to accept data of varying resolutions and irregular sampling geometries as well as the algorithmic speed that is linear in the number of grid points.  Using this approach ALPHATECH will evaluate the performance of Passive TF/TA under data of varying resolutions.  This study will help determine the data and hardware requirements for an operational Passive TF/TA system. The proposed technology will provide the army with a passive solution for Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance.

This proposal addresses the cooperative platform control problem where the control task is to coordinate teams of small expendable platforms to perform Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) tasks. When viewed as a centralized control problem under uncertainty Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) provides the optimal control strategy for this stochastic problem; however this solution approach is not computationally feasible for most problems and requires excessive centralization of information and computation. Moreover the impact of imperfect communication performance decreases the overall performance achievable by large centrally controlled teams.  We propose innovative distributed control architectures that extend previous ALPHATECH Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) successes to cooperative control of teams of UAVs.

The Phase I work organized around a simulation-based trade study begins with the evaluation of a centralized architecture.

Phase II extends the work of Phase I by incorporating additional dimensions in the trade space and increasing the size and realism of the simulation. The proposed technology would enable autonomous teams of distributed UAVs to cooperatively perform reconnaissance search tracking relay communications target identification and provide navigational guidance in a highly dynamic uncertain environment with limited human input. This concept of operations would support a rapid tailoring of ISR resources and thus achieve the benefits of the large more traditional UAVs with greatly reduced cost and increased effectiveness.

The sensor is well suited to deployment on an autonomous air vehicle such as a tactical unmanned air vehicle TUAV or autonomous munitions.  By providing fast high resolution range information the sensor can be used to provide targeting or obstacle avoidance capability or used to direct sensor resources to regions of interest for high resolution foveal inspection. In addition to improving guidance navigation and obstacle avoidance for autonomous air vehicles and smart munitions the biomimetic range sensor described below can be applied to both manned and unmanned ground vehicles. It can be used to provide 3D vision capability for industrial robots in manufacturing and to monitor sensitive facilities in security applications.  In consumer automobiles.  The sensor can be used to rapidly measure the range to obstacles and other vehicles for example it could warn of  insufficient braking distance to a car ahead.  In this capacity it would be useful for the Department of Transportation's Intelligent Highway Project.  It could also be used to warn of children or obstacles behind a car or truck which is backing up.  Unlike sonar based detectors for these applications it is not sensitive to jamming and unlike laser radar systems it poses no eye-safety hazards.  For autonomous ground based vehicles the sensor can provide the same guidance and navigation capability as proposed for autonomous air vehicles.

Existing UAS electronic systems are bulky and inefficient (electrons operate in the diffusive transport regime). It is well defined that the key limiting factor of CNT RF transistor technology is the presence of metallic CNT that occurs during the CNT growth process. These metallic CNT components are responsible for unacceptable Ioff currents that cripple Ion/Ioff ratios and suffocates the electrostatic field effect on the semiconducting channel resulting in low transconductance (gm). Our approach to this SBIR Phase I is to increase device efficiency beyond III-V devices by evoking the CNT ballistic transport regime. In order to realize this goal we plan to (a) reduce metallic tubes by optimizing CNT aligned grow processes (b) increase CNT density for higher current capacity (uA/um) and (c) further optimize CNT FET device design and fabricate a LNA aiming to demonstrate positive gain.  BENEFIT:  The US Armed forces are embracing unmanned aerial systems (UAS) as critical tools for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and in some cases also for strike missions in particular in counter-insurgency operations. Based on Visiongain’s research (www.visiongain.com) global spending in 2009 on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) reached $5.1bn. Over the forecast period of 2010-2020 the cumulative UAV market will total nearly $71bn.	 Within these systems a great dependence lies with advances in electronics in particular where one could decrease weight increase battery lifetime and reduce power consumption. This is where advances in low power light and robust circuits developed within this project can make a dramatic impact to the performance of these UAS systems. In addition advances from this proposal have the potential to revolutionize the $60 billion analog and mixed signal semiconductor markets. As an example of potential market size Analog electronics (making use of CNT superior RF properties) sales were over $47 billion in 2009 (11.1 percent CAGR).","F103-167-1304","AF103-167","10.3",

These included a low-cost transmitter module to extend the data rate to greater than 1Mb/s and an improved receiver capable of high speed operation through a broad frequency range. The simplicity of an UWB avionics package permits the development of a common electronics module capable of performing altimeter obstacle avoidance/data link and transponder position/recovery funcial airframes.  Cruise and ballistic missiles are also likely platforms because of the module's low-cost and LPI signal characteristics.  Aircraft trains ships and automobiles will benefit fromn the development of a highly reliable obstacle avoidance radar and precise position/recovery system. The modules can be adapted to serve the growing need for wireless data transmission systems.

We introduce a new approximation method called nominal belief-state optimization (NBO). We show that NBO combined with other application-specific approximations and techniques within the POMDP framework produces a practical design that coordinates the UAVs to achieve good long-term mean-squared-error tracking performance in the presence of occlusions and dynamic constraints. Although the POMDP/NBO combination exemplifies increased tracking performance this performance gain can be hindered by computational complexity.

Broadband conformal antennas offer unique solutions to the strict size weight and power requirements for sensors deployed on UAS. Multi-functional conformal antennas can also address the issue of antenna locations that arise from limited real estate. Typical UAV telemetry systems operating at UHF or L-band frequencies usually employ blade and wire antennas on the fuselage and protrude into the air stream. These antennas degrade aerodynamics increase drag increase weight and usually provide less than optimal antenna performance. These problems can be largely eliminated by conformal (and/or embedded) antennas into UAV composite structures.

During this effort Applied EM is proposing to develop very accurate modeling tools to predict performance of DF systems on rotorcrafts. DF arrays are normally designed without accounting for platform effects. When mounted on a UAV the operation of the direction-finding array is greatly affected by interactions of the antenna elements with the UAV structure. For a fixed wing UAV these effects are mitigated by calibrating the DF array with the UAV structure. But for a rotorcraft UAV they cannot be implemented due to the inherent dynamic conditions associated with the rotating blades.

Cruise and sea skimming missiles are the most difficult target to intercept at long range with line of sight weapons such as lasers beam weapons and high power microwaves because of the near earth operation.    Practical concerns require a hard kill that is obvious destruction or destabilization of the target rather than a soft target kill in which the guidance electronics or memory may be impaired but invisible to the defense system. This proposal addresses these problems by establishing a long range defensive perimeter through delivery of a defensive package  to a point near the path of the target missile where the defensive package then generates a repetitive high power ultra-wideband electromagnetic impulse or EM-UWB.      The EM generation package can be delivered to the target via inexpensive missile projectile or via a UAV.

Unfortunately the sun can blind and/or damage these sensors if precautions are not built into the sensor. APS is proposing to use an ultra-narrowband filter (0.001 nm) called a Differential Doppler Imager (DDI) to reject the broadband blackbody spectrum of the sun; it uses an atomic emission line from the sun itself as the illumination source for the object.  The filter is passively (naturally) locked to the chosen atomic line and only allows that line to pass through the optical system.  Rejection of background light can be very high (enables imaging in solar disk) while maintaining high in band filter transmission.  APS has: a unique atomic physics computer code that properly models these filters the ability to model the full optical system performance and built many of them at a variety of wavelengths. Since the DDI uses the Doppler shift of atomic lines to reject background the device can also measure the line of sight velocity component of the debris.  BENEFIT:  The successful demonstration of imaging in very high dynamic range conditions could have many possible applications in both defense and industry.  The proposed instrument enables the GEO satellites to identify track and avoid potentially lethal debris.  This technology could also be used to build an optical ground moving target indicator instrument for satellite aircraft or UAV surveillance missions.

A wide instantaneous radar bandwidth is essential for defeating these threats resulting in improved range resolution and target signature. Digital beamforming may be used to defeat radar jammers by forming precise beams and steering receive nulls in the direction of hostile jammers. DBF may be used on transmit to improve target-to-clutter ratio and reduce the spillover of transmit energy in undesired directions. This wideband DBF approach also lends itself to the use of digital transmit waveforms which may be used as a further technique for defeating countermeasures.     This SBIR effort will leverage Applied Radar's on-going work in the DBF area and direct it towards missile defense applications of vital importance to US national security. Specifically we will research ways of significantly improving the bandwidth over the current state-of-the-art. Our existing MMIC-based analog front-ends are sufficiently wideband. The main bandwidth bottleneck is in the real-time digital data acquisition and DBF processing. We will investigate techniques that move the data acquisition closer to the radar antenna array resulting in improved performance and reduced cost.

DBF eliminates these performance variations and allows the beams to be optimized for the application. It is not unreasonable to expect 30dB or better sidelobes from a DBF system and deep nulls can be steered for jam suppression. One other major advantage to DBF is that multiple simultaneous beams can be formed to look in several directions simultaneously. Multiple functions such as communications and radar can also be integrated and multiplexed in the same aperture. This proposal addresses the development of low-cost DBF modules employing the integration of MMICs and digital hardware.

Switching in various transmit/receive (T/R) front ends will allow the DREX hardware to be used in various discrete radar bands such as UHF S L C or X-band with a common digital back-end.

Using DBF the beamwidths beam-shapes scan locations and null locations of the multiple beams are all controlled digitally and may be adjusted rapidly for example to follow a moving target suppress a hostile jammer or to reduce multi-path.

The OAS utilizes the Game-theoretic Optimal Deformable Zone including Inertia with Local Approach (GODZILA) algorithms for autonomous path planning which were developed and validated by simulation during Phase I.  Accomplishment of this work exceeded the original Phase I proposed effort and encouraged the proposal of a flight test in Phase II.  GODZILA requires no prior knowledge of the geography of the environment and the algorithm is attractive because it computes a heading command based only on a matrix of scalar sensor measurements.  It is not necessary to accurately reconstruct the size and shape of obstacles in order to avoid them thus greatly reducing the computational and sensor requirements. Realization of the flight test system is fa-cilitated by use of inexpensive Commercial-Off-The-Shelf components including the aircraft it-self avionics sensors and ground station which are simply plugged together mitigating sched-ule and technical risk.  A comprehensive integration and test plan is presented which culminates in the UAV negotiating an urban canyon at low altitude while transmitting back live video intel-ligence data as a validation of the practicality of the system.GODZILA has wide-ranging applications to the military and private sectors including manned aircraft obstacle avoidance Spacecraft and UAV collision avoidance Underwater Vehicle obstacle avoidance pipeline and powerline right of way surveillance Search and Rescue and agricultural and livestock monitoring.","A2-1060","A01-063","01.2",

In order to accomplish this task autonomous vehicles must   have the ability to make decisions assess their health and environment dynamically  re-plan and control their movements in a dynamic and unpredictable environment.   Our goal is to design an affordable control technique that 1) reduces the necessary   human interaction 2) responds to both anticipated and unanticipated events   3) allows easy verification and validation of vehicle behavior and 4) is as effective  as an equivalent manned vehicle. In order to meet these objectives ASI plans to   implement an associate decision aiding system that uses knowledge about the   environment and context in which it is operating as well as the potential purposes   of the system and its operators. It can act in concert with one or more humans  to perform complex tasks and is designed explicitly to work interactively and   cooperatively with human counterparts unlike either conventional automation or   autonomous software agents.Demand for unmanned vehicle systems continues to grow in every major world region.  The United States as well as many foreign countries have UAVs all of which could   take advantage of our system. Military systems can also utilize components of our   technology by implementing data fusion and situation assessment capabilities.  Data  fusion can be part of a collaborative intelligence network.  Situation assessment   technology can be used in a variety of domains including battlefield management   flight operations and mission planning.  Although military procurement will continue to represent the majority of industry   revenues intense competition in military markets will force some companies to gear   new marketing efforts toward civil and commercial customers.  As such ASI plans to   broaden the market for associate systems by pursuing commercial opportunities for   our technology and products particularly in air traffic management general aviation  and agricultural vehicles.   Specifically from this SBIR we expect to apply the   concepts of controlling unmanned vehicles to agricultural domains from combines to   professional turf maintenance vehicles. We also expect to utilize advanced flight   navigation concepts in unmanned Department of Transportation traffic monitoring and   police surveillance vehicles.    In addition to using our technology in unmanned systems we can also extract components  of the total system for use in situation assessment displays and data fusion   applications.  Our situation assessment module would be particularly successful in   an advanced cockpit setting like that proposed by the FAA's Advanced General Aviation  Transport Experiments (AGATE) program.  This program is designed in part to develop  affordable low-cost intuitive cockpit displays that provide situation weather and  traffic awareness to support Free Flight.

The main components of our innovative system include: (1) physical layer based ADS-B spoofing detection; (2) onboard sensors based ADS-B spoofing detection; (3) ground ADS-B spoofing detection; (4) information fusion of multiple ADS-B spoofing detectors. Physical layer based ADS-B spoofing detection and Dempster-Shafer fusion are two core components of our proposed technique. Our algorithm is applicable to all airspaces no matter they are covered by radars/Multilateration or not. The physical layer based method can detect not only the spoofing attack in the air (spoof ADS-B report of aircraft) but also spoofing attack on the ground (spoof the ground station broadcasting). Our physical layer enhanced information fusion system for airborne ADS-B spoofing detection has wide military and commercial applications.  BENEFIT:  This innovative physical layer enhanced information fusion approach for detection of air-to-air and ground-to-air spoofed ADS-B reports has large potential applications for military and commercial platforms. The primary DoD applications include manned military aircraft unmanned military aircraft and helicopter. Our ADS-B spoofing detection technique can protect DOD aircraft from denial of aircraft access attacks via spoofed ADS-B reports. Commercial applications include civil aircraft and UAVs. It can be used directly in the Next Generation Air Transportation Systems (NextGen) to improve the safety capacity and efficiency of commercial flights.","F093-141-1224","AF093-141","09.3",

Additionally UARS provides a method for authenticated wireless inventory of munitions in storage.   UARS is comprised of rugged long-life queriable RFID tags that are adhered to the outside of ordnance such as the Mk82 500lb. bomb forward of the tail kit.  The system’s reader can be mounted on a UAV carried on the ground by explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel or unmanned vehicle/robot or be used cooperatively in the ground and onboard air assets via a built in long-range wireless mesh network.  UARS utilizes modern RF technology that is proven to work while buried underground and is specifically tuned to provide a safe stand-off range to EOD personnel. Phase II of the UARS program aims to produce MIL-STD certified external tags for munitions tracking that are commercially ready for DoD adoption.  Based on extensive modeling and simulation in Phase I ARES believes UARS will provide a superior RF performance the lowest design risk and delivery schedule that quickly equips EOD personnel with this cost saving technology.    BENEFIT:  Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) clearing continues to pose an expensive and dangerous proposition for U.S. and Allied forces civilian populations and environmental cleanup efforts around the world.  While the EPA estimates that UXO cleanup in the U.S. will cost roughly $14 billion overall a single recent cleanup operation on Kaho''olawe Island Hawaii cost the Navy $330M.  For the same estimated cost of the Kaho’olawe cleanup the U.S. government could switch to UARS based technology and tag every single air dropped munition for the next 50 years while reducing lost lives and injuries. Opportunity cost savings at ranges equipped with UARS could amount to as much as $120000 per day.  The commercialization of UARS technology will not only impact CONUS test-range operations but will also benefit overseas soldiers advancing across pre-bombed battlefields reducing the time to clear the field and the risk to coalition soldiers.    Additionally the specific RFID tags being designed for UARS possess additional characteristics that make them an ideal candidate for future government tagging technology.  Their secure authentication protocol long battery life and long above-ground range makes them ideal for add-on equipment inventory applications or locating key assets during disaster recovery operations.  An example of this includes quick identification of sensitive assets in buried rubble such as an embassy bombing or downed aircraft. ","F2-5395","AF083-236","08.3",

AROSS is a field-tested and robust electro-optical system producing time-series imagery with sufficient resolution and spatial coverage for Navy METOC requirements.  The approximate cost of $2000 per hour to fly AROSS while not expensive by military standards restricts its non-warfare or commercial use and its participation in ongoing scientific research.  The development of a system similar to AROSS which can utilize commercial aircraft would cost less to build and reduce operating cost by a factor of 5 to 10.  The limitation of the new system will be a restriction in the viewing geometry resulting from using a downward looking viewport instead of a military-based turret.  Arete proposes to assess the effects of the restricted viewing geometry using AROSS data and determine the engineering requirements to mount such a system on standard commercial aircraft.The successful transfer of AROSS technology to a system capable of being mounted in a commercial aircraft will be an inexpensive oceanographic research asset.  This asset will directly benefit the Navy wave modeling community who require wide-area measurements of METOC parameters including directional wave spectra in the littoral zone.  The lower operating cost of the proposed system will be more in-line with the budgets of typical field experiments designed to enhance scientific understanding of coastal processes.

This system would collect a time series of electro-optical images over a precisely fixed area of the ocean to provide wave spectra. This information would be analyzed to determine important coastal ocean parameters such as bathymetry wave characteristics and surface currents. The coastal-zone of the ocean is spatially and temporally complex exhibitng a number of physical processes occurring simultaneously. Specific items of interest include ocean swell wind-driven waves mean and variance in turbulent fluxes breaking waves and currents. In the coastal zones the situation is complicated by significant spatial gradients that cause inhomogeneities on relatively small spatial scales. Although small on geophysical scales these coastal features are too extensive and complex to be measured well by a small number of research vessels or buoys yet they are too small and vary too rapidly to be measured by satellite sensors. What is needed is an instrument system that can measure many of the required parameters but is small and lightweight so that it can be mounted in an aircraft and therefore cover a wide area of interest over a relatively long span of time. Arete has determined that a system can be developed which uses an electro-optical sensor (digital camera) mounted in a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) to collect wave spectra data which can be analyzed to provide information on waves currents and costal-zone bathymetry. The camera and turret system will be directly transferrable to small UAVs such as the predator.

Tactical UAVs having time-series imaging (i.e. video-like) capability are extremely important to be able to detect partially obscured transient movements and to calculate precise locations of targets of high interest in order to deliver effective retaliation against asymmetric attacks (Such a capability also can provide enhanced targeting for sea-based fire support utilizing the future Extended Range Guided Munition).  Finally accurate target positioning from UAV's could provide support to special operations teams through situational awareness and "bubble cover" for detecting adverse movements in their vicinity.  Prior ONR investment including the Airborne Remote Optical Spotlight System Littoral Remote Sensing Mine Counter Measures Future Naval Capabilities and Precise Tactical Targeting programs has developed research-and-development algorithms to calculate the accurate positioning of targets (3-5 m Spherical Error of Probability at 3 km standoff).  The objective of this Phase I is to automate these algorithms to such a degree that they can provide the foundation for a Phase II effort to achieve precise geo-location of stationary targets; detection geo-location and tracking of moving targets; and operation in real-time by a typical fleet operator.     Areté Associates has developed algorithms under multiple ONR programs that provide precise geo-positioning of targets of interest.  Thus far these algorithms are exercised post-flight require significant manual manipulation and do not provide real-time performance.  This SBIR project (Phase I + Phase II) is to automate the techniques used to generate precision geo-location of targets in such a way as to allow real-time operation and demonstrate it on a surrogate ground station system.  There is a need for automated algorithms of this kind to support DoD and US Coast Guard missions.  We have demonstrated targeting accuracy of 3-5 m at 3 km standoff using our manually intensive algorithms which is much better than what is available from current-generation UAV platforms like the USAF Predator.  The development of these algorithms will provide significant risk reduction and will speed transition of this critical technology to operational UAV systems.","N022-0075","N02-207/4","02.2",

Unlike the P-3C the P-8A will not carry magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) equipment aboard the aircraft. To execute its ASW mission successfully the P-8A must replace the detection and localization capability offered by traditional MAD. One approach is provided by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with MAD sensors. The development of compact total field magnetometers as well as air-launched Tier 1 and Tier 2 aircraft have made this approach a robust affordable option for high altitude ASW.  Still magnetic detection from a UAV faces serious challenges. The most significant is platform noise which is much greater in amplitude and more complex than that encountered aboard large manned aircraft such as the P-3C. Platform noise greatly dominates typical MAD signals if left uncompensated rendering the UAV useless as a MAD platform.  Arete successfully developed and tested an adaptive magnetic platform noise reduction system for small UAVs.

The most significant catalyst has been the enormous growth of interest in UAVs by the US military tied to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the general trend towards information warfare and net-centric systems. UAVs are a key element in the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) portion of this revolution and they are expanding into other missions as well with the advent of hunter-killer UAVs like the Predator and Reaper which are equipped with the latest targeting and laser guided missiles. Efforts to reduce the cost operational footprint and platform vulnerability have led to the development and successful deployment of thousands of small UAV. There is a growing need to add targeting capabilities (acquisition and designation) to small UAS by integrating small laser designator systems into the payload. Advances in miniature laser technology will aid in improving the performance of legacy hunter-killer platforms and will help enable targeting capabilities of small UAV. Scalable ultra-low SWaP laser architectures that lead to increased operating ranges and endurance from small platforms are highly desired. Laser configurations must be inherently thermally and mechanically stable over extreme temperatures shock vibration and must be capable of operating in high radiation environments. Areté Associates proposes to mature a disruptive new ultra-compact and efficient laser technology called AIRTRAC that promises to meet these stringent requirements. The AIRTRAC configuration combined with Areté’s “coffin” athermal gain module dramatically reduce size weight and power (SWaP) requirements on severely constrained platforms. AIRTRAC’s self-aligning dimensionally stable cavity configuration is extremely robust over harsh environmental conditions. In this Phase-II SBIR Areté will build two technology demonstrator versions of the AIRTRAC: One for the high-altitude hunter-killer platforms (Predator Reaper) and another for the small marker UAS platforms (Puma AE TigerShark Cutlass). These tech demonstrator units will be tested and qualified over the environment to achieve an exit maturity of TRL-5.  BENEFIT:  A host of other military and civilian applications benefit from the development of compact and rugged high power brightness and efficiency solid-state lasers sources. Complimentary military applications include long-range air- and space-borne lidar and ladar systems which are hosted on platforms with limited payload and power capacities. The development of a new ultra-compact AIRTRAC laser configuration will provide > 50 mJ of high beam quality output in a package that requiring less than 6 cu-in in volume and < 0.5 lbs which is well below the current state-of-the-art in compact laser designators. Moreover the integration of Areté’s athermal gain module eliminates diode temperature control requirement increasing the laser efficiency by a factor-of-two.  AIRTRAC promises to meet future demand for an ultra low SWAP laser designator for ground based warfighters and small UAVs.  The design is particularly novel because it enables full compliance with NATO PRF/PIM codes and pulsewidths in this very compact package.  AIRTRAC is a scalable architecture that can be applied to other more traditional laser designator markets where higher energies are required. A host of civilian applications benefit from the development of an ultra-compact light-weight and efficient solid-state laser source including law enforcement homeland security surveillance and search and rescue.","F2-6914","MDA10-016","10.3",

Areté will design and build a receive module for LADAR that captures target returns as well as a “copy” of the outgoing pulse. Collection of the outgoing pulse provides additional information for advanced signal processing. The module will be built with programmable real-time on-board processing.  As a result modern signal processing techniques can be exploited to improve range accuracy probability of detection and reduce false alarm rates. In addition Areté will provide software tools to program the onboard processor; develop a set of “factory” processor images to address several generic customer objectives; develop software to interact with the hardware so that the user will be able to collect process and store the data products.    In Phase I Areté will develop a system design using a combination of modeling and simulation tools to investigate design trade-offs develop signal processing algorithms and forecast system performance.    In Phase II Areté will produce a brassboard prototype of the receiver.  The brassboard will be designed to augment ladar development research in the laboratory while demonstrating functionality and SWAP appropriate to ISR and seeker applications.    BENEFIT:  Development of a low SWAP ladar receiver has many applications in defense and commercial applications.  High dynamic range real-time receivers are appropriate for both seeker and ISR missions that utilize small UAV’s.  Successful completion of this SBIR effort will result in demonstration of a brassboard system that is readily adapted to multiple products to support DOD applications.","F121-108-1288","AF121-108","12.1",

In order to accomplish covert missions our Special Operations Forces must avoid being observed by this expanding enemy capability.  The ability to organically eliminate the threat of an enemy UAV would significantly enhance our soldier’s ability to stay covert and improve the mission’s operational timeline.  Adding a lethal attack capability to existing Small and Micro Air Vehicles would provide this organic capability to our Special Forces.  This program will leverage research from an Air Force Phase I SBIR and the ongoing development of Areté’s innovative Terminal Accuracy Guidance System Imaging Technology (TAGSIT) to deliver Proportional Navigation performance by processing imagery from a Strapdown seeker.   The barriers for deploying current imaging seeker technologies on small UAVs are cost size weight and power.  Gyro-stabilized gimbals that steer the imaging sensor such as the one used in the AIM-9X Sidewinder missile are typically used to generate the inertial Line-Of-Sight (LOS) rate information required by the guidance algorithms.  TAGSIT will use Optical Flow and other algorithms to deliver Proportional Navigation guidance performance without the weight and cost of gyros or gimbals.

Argon proposes to implement FFT channelization before beamforming using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  This allows both beamforming and advanced signal detection algorithms performed in general purpose processors to use the same underlying correlation matrix formed by multiplying pair-wise antenna inputs.  Signal digital direction finding can be implemented on detected signals by Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) multipath immune MODE or other array DF algorithms.    This digital architecture is investigated for aircraft DF implementation where the receivers are located with their antennas passing digital data to FPGA and processors using Fiber Optic (FO) paths to eliminate bulky and variable RF cables that cause phase errors and path loss.  One of the SBIR goals is to investigate the feasibility of implementing advanced adaptive digital beamforming with a forward digitization architecture using FO digital signal routing.    One of the key objectives of this SBIR is to reduce size weight and power for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) where the weight must be less than 200 pounds and power less than 200 watts. Employing our business model Argon Engineering Associates plans to incorporate the primary innovative technology of digital adaptive beam-forming into the product line for integration into future LIGHTHOUSE based systems.

One important area of development for HPM devices is ballistic missile defense (BMD).  HPM systems and techniques may be able to disrupt damage or destroy critical elements of adversary ballistic missile systems rendering them ineffective.  However the goal is to be able to have these effects at long standoff distances which is often difficult given the limited space available on appropriate BMD platforms such as interceptor missiles.  There are several ways to improve the standoff range of an HPM system.  The first is to increase the total power on target.  The second is to increase the effectiveness at a given power level by improving coupling and damage effects.  ASR Corporation (ASR) has been working in conjunction with Prof. J.

The ONYX is a developed parachute delivery system with a GPS & inertial sensor integrated flight computer pneumatic actuator system and high-efficiency parafoil. The ONYX divides out the requirements of guided flight and soft landing between two specifically designed canopies. This dual parachute design utilizes a high efficiency high wing-load elliptical primary parafoil for guided flight and secondary unguided parachute at light wing-loading for final touchdown. Additional features include an inventive hydraulic timer that deploys the primary parachute after drogue fall to insure a stable deployment as well as a harness and container system that can accomplish a canopy transfer from primary to secondary in any flight orientation (level flight or in a diving spin). The ONYX has already been developed and successfully tested for weights of 100 to 500 lbs (current company funded effort was focused on scaling up to 2000 lbs) with final demonstration scheduled for NATICK in September 2002 . Autonomous high altitude deployable precision aerial delivery systems are of great need and benefit to the military. Air drops at high altitude greatly reduces the aircrafts vulnerability to low cost surface to air weapons. Precision delivery greatly reduces recovery time and vulnerability to cargo and recipient.

Unlike conventional gain scheduling techniques that require design and testing of tens or hundreds of control design points and switching among each Feedback LTI'zation uniquely achieves this with the design of only a few design points valid and stable over the entire flight envelope.

A target selling price of $20000 (for the UAV and small missile market) to $50000 (for launch vehicle market) makes the highly reliable mFCS an affordable solution for a range of users missions and vehicles.  This architecture has a number of military and commercial spin-offs that are detailed in the body of the proposal.        In Phase I Athena worked with Honeywell Defense Avionics to conduct architecture trade studies and develop a concept design.  In Phase II Athena will work with Honeywell Orbital Sciences corporation and Aurora Flight Sciecnes Corporation to design fabricate and test a prototype system. An option is proposed under which Athena will deliver flight hardware and support a space launch demonstration.","F2-0028","AF00-065","00.1",

(Athena) proposes to develop an affordable lighweight and low power INS/GPS integrated flight control system (FCS) hereafter referred to as micro-FCS capable of guidance navigation and control of expendable unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). The proposed approach leverages Athena's expertise in design fabrication and operational qualification of our miniaturized GuideStar flight control hardware and our patented and flight-demonstrated Feedback LTI'zation control algorithms. Unlike conventional gain scheduling techniques that require design and testing of tens or hundreds of control design points and switching among each Feedback LTI'zation uniquely achieves this with the design of only a few design points valid and stable over the entire flight envelope. This design formulation elegantly produces robust and very small footprint control algorithms resulting in efficient software maintenance moderate computational requirements and overall reduction in software life cycle costs. We believe Athena's expertise in highly-integrated hardware design combined with the elegance of our flight control algorithms affords a powerful and innovative solution in producing a new generation of miniaturized and very affordable advanced avionics applicable to a myriad of expendable UAV systems. The future global commerical potential for the micro-FCS in the model airplane market will be enormous and will allow a larger group of people with little or no training the ability to fly hard to fly airplanes and helicopters. Further small man-portable and expendable air vehicles will have a significant role in future reconanaissance operations for military and many law enforcement agencies.","N012-0501","N01-147","01.2",

Aurora Flight Sciences proposes to explore CUAV designs that emulate natural or common airborne objects to deploy covert packages on the highest local terrain "perch" for maximum line-of-sight viewing. This strategy enables the delivery vehicle to loiter or cruise in the enemy's area of operation and identify the optimal site for covert package delivery. Aurora will apply its expertise in UAV configuration synthesis flight control design and scene interpretation to create a CUAV system to meet the Concept of Operations. Aurora will investigate a range of designs trading cost covertness and military effectiveness and using the requirements to down-select for Phase II prototyping and system demonstration. Aurora Flight Sciences is an internationally recognized leader in the development and rapid prototyping of unconventional military and civilian UAV configurations. Aurora has 10 years of successful UAV design fabrication and operation experience including high-altitude UAVs Micro-Air Vehicles Vertical Take-off and Landing UAVs planetary UAVs and aerodynamically unstable Unmanned-Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) prototypes. In contrast to larger more noticeable UAVs Clandestine UAVs are favorably unique for their small size mass and slow speed. Therefore they pose minimum liability if they impact a person or another object. Finally a common feature to all Clandestine UAVs is that they are considered disposable systems. So these attributes put together open doors to potential areas where the CUAV can have near-term benefit: - Covert Law Enforcement Operation- Target designation- Over the hill observation- Entertainment and sport event coverage- Aerial Photography surveying and photogrammetry- Hazard and emergency response- Damage assessment- Power line inspectionThe above list is only a sample of potential applications; however Aurora is committed to pursue the military and commercial markets with a capable autonomous Clandestine UAV system and its variants.

For the past three years Aurora Flight Sciences has used support from the National Science Foundation to develop a lightweight autonomous dropwindsonde system (LADS) specifically for use with UAVS. This system developed in cooperation with Radian Corporation uses the Global Position System (GPS) for windfinding and thus offers both world-wide coverage and accuracies an order of magnitude better than current windfinding radiosonde systems. NSF and Aurora funds have paid to design and produce the first LADS prototype hardware which is now ready for flight demonstration. In this proposal we request funds to: (1) flight-test the existing hardware on an Aurora-owned UAV and (2) prepare a preliminary design for a complete MET package incorporating the LADS system but adding other in situ sensors to measure temperature humidity radiation opacity etc. Deliverables from Phase I would consist of a report plus videotapes of the flight demonstration. In Phase II we would fabricate a complete LADS/MET system install it on a UAV (supplied at the customer's convenience by either the customer or Aurora) and demonstrate it in flight.

The capability to scavenge energy from the environment to recharge batteries and/or directly power electronics is essential to increase system lifetime and utility.  Solar radiation is the most abundant and highest power source for scavenging but is completely absent at night.  Consequently alternative power system designs are needed which supplement solar based scavengers with complementary techniques minimizing impact on system size and weight.  Aurora proposes to develop an integrated energy scavenging and storage system which utilizes: 1) triple junction solar cells for highly efficient solar energy scavenging 2) advanced infrared photovoltaics for night time thermal energy scavenging and 3) thin film lithium cell technology to produce a power dense storage system.  These component technologies will be stacked in a layered fashion and integrated with the system structure to provide additional weight savings and footprint reduction.

This scheme is representative of the situation encountered in VTOL UAV design and the design of new turbo-props and variable pitch turbofans by the large commercial gas turbine manufacturers. In Phase II Aurora proposes to develop the partially distributed controller from Phase I further to cover safe performance during non standard operations (including sensor failure etc.) culminating in a static engine test of a small turbo-prop engine  running the developed distributed adaptive controller.  BENEFIT:  Moving to a distributed architecture will increase flexibility through common standards improve redundancy properties by improving the overall system topology and allow for self-diagnosing components and other benefits of ‘smart’ actuators and sensors such as reduced harness weight. Distributed computing in the smart components allows for localization of A/D conversion and signal processing supports open standards and modularity and provides an opportunity for self-diagnosis. Beyond this our approach will tap into the full potential of a distributed architecture by allowing the control algorithms themselves to be distributed. This reduces the system’s dependence on the FADEC reducing the number of redundant components and interconnections required to insure reliability.

However incorporation of local UAV data into the intelligence datastream is still limited and more importantly coordination of data gathering platforms is not automated or optimized. As the number of UAVs in the battlespace increases the potential for fast and accurate localization identification designation and prosecution of time-sensitive targets will only be realized if mechanisms for coordinating assets are developed. Aurora is proposing to develop an approach that covers all the aspects of the solicited technology for multi-platform multi-sensor (MPMS) tracking of multiple targets from sensor modeling to data association and fusion to optimal sensor platform and information management. Innovative resource allocation algorithms based on the Robust Decentralized Task Assignment (RDTA) technique jointly developed by Aurora and MIT and successfully demonstrated in recent STTR and SBIR efforts will be developed and implemented to allow multiple UAVs to optimally coordinate efficiently directing the available sensors to collect the information required to effectively perform their missions. Auroras work to date on multi-vehicle coordination puts it in a unique position to meet the MPMS coordination challenge.  BENEFIT: Whether integrated into a large battlespace or used locally by a team of UAVs supporting special forces there is significant warfighter value available from methodologies for multi-platform multiple-sensor (MPMS) coordination for the purpose of optimizing information extraction from ISR data fusion.  Simply having many sensors in the sky especially limited capability sensors (due to UAV cost/size limits) is not sufficient to meet the Air Forces vision for dominance through information superiority. It is critical to get the right combination of sensors at the right location(s) at the right time and to do so in a complex environment of targets friendly forces and air vehicles. Thus we see the MPMS problem as an opportunity to provide the final link in the net-centric warfare chain a chain which includes UAV platform technologies sensor and sensor fusion technologies communication human interfaces and control and multi-vehicle coordination. While the focus of this development effort will be on meeting the needs of the Air Force Aurora will also seek other commercial applications of the technology. In addition to its wide military application including ISR missions it is envisioned that the developed technology for coordinated sensor fusion and management can be used for numerous civil operations such as traffic flow and delay assessment forest fire monitoring border security civilian search and rescue weather and climate studies and even space/Mars exploration.","F083-054-0619","AF083-054","08.3",

Of particular interest is the tracking of multiple targets for global situational awareness. To accomplish this mission UAVs can be equipped with a myriad of different types of sensors which can be combined in complementary ways for increased tracking performance. It is critical to get the right combination of sensors at the right location(s) at the right time and to do so in a complex environment of targets friendly forces and air vehicles. To achieve this capability Aurora is proposing to pursue the work accomplished during Phase I and develop a prototype software package embodying the core algorithms enabling collaborative multi-target tracking and validate this prototype in realistic hardware-in-the-loop simulations and flight-test demonstrations. For this purpose Aurora will continue to work with MIT to further increase the capabilities and performance of the system finalizing the core technologies and leverage the team’s considerable infrastructure for multi-vehicle testing developed over the past 4 years to successfully validate and demonstrate the system’s performance. Aurora’s work to date on multi-vehicle coordination puts it in a unique position to reach this goal.  BENEFIT:  Military planners across all the services have identified the need for technologies that provide 1) real-time or near-real time automated sensing and understanding of the battle space using multiple distributed unmanned platforms; 2) autonomous platform and surveillance tasking to recognize and identify threats and hold them at risk; 3) integration of disparate autonomous capabilities; and 4) implementation of these in an open non-proprietary architecture.  Aurora’s tools will directly address these needs.  By virtue of its place in the military UAS market  Aurora is motivated to provide open and extensible tools that can be integrated as third-party software or hardware components onto a broad range of UAVs; this perspective as well as Aurora’s ongoing commitment to the military standards and common-control development efforts will benefit the Air Force as well as other military UAS end-users providing them with cross-platform collaboration path planning and sensor fusion tools for team situations.  Commercial applications will emerge as well as UAVs become more accepted for civilian use and include fire reconnaissance and fire-fighting support search and rescue and homeland security.  All of these applications will benefit from efficient use of resources and intelligent fusion of sensor measurements.","F2-5423","AF083-054","08.3",

By implementing a feedback loop on the actual force or moment output of the lifting surface this concept has the potential to provide higher bandwidth rejection of gusts and other disturbances by reducing measurement latencies and using feedback to provide robustness to aerodynamic uncertainties.  Such uncertainties can occur due to operation in complex aerodynamic regimes (e.g. low Reynolds (Re) number effects such as separation bubbles vortex lift stalled surfaces or complex interacting surfaces) incomplete modeling or aerodynamic surface damage.  Aurora will validate the concept as originally described by AFRL and also test a number of novel proprietary extensions.  Innovative sensors from UMD will also be investigated.        BENEFIT:  Methods for SUAV flight in gusty environments are among the key technologies for future SUAVs performing military operations.  The need for more stable robust flight of MAVs and SUAVs is clear to anyone who has tested or used these vehicles at low speeds (for urban maneuvering perch or hover-and-stare operations) in windy or gusty situations – these operations are very challenging and performance stands to be significantly improved by Proprioceptive Wings.  Aurora’s commitment to and experience in quickly fielding new vehicles will greatly increase the probability of transition of the Proprioceptive Wing concept to operational vehicles with enhanced capabilities.

The Air Force and OSD emphasize an increasing role for SUAVs and providing squad-level units with ever-more capable man-packable air assets.  These smarter and smaller UAVs will perform complex including below roofline urban ISR and precision strike.  Conventional fixed-wing vehicles with IMU-based control laws do not meet the performance required to operate in these environments; bio-inspired approaches to sensing control and actuation will need to be incorporated.  Proprioception a technique to react to environmental disturbances reflexively using torque feedback is under investigation by Aurora and AFRL through the use of torque error to control actuator position and the use of body force sensing to compensate for high optical/outer-loop sensor feedback latency.  Extending the approach to all three rotational axes and by applying the concept in a more distributed fashion along the wing for example provides even more improvement.  Coupling this with bio-inspired vehicle concepts such as distributed actuation yields an exceptionally capable vehicle.  Aurora will work with the University of Maryland to analyze available COTS and other cutting edge sensors to extend the concept of proprioceptive sensing to its performance ceiling.  BENEFIT:  The PWings system provides three potential productization paths (1) as a self-contained package installed as an after-market modification (2) as a system to be included in the build-up/development of new systems and (3) as a fully functional high performing aircraft produced and sold by Aurora.  PWings is attractive to any customer seeking controllable flight in gustier conditions greater maneuverability and lifetime wing load monitoring and gust-load alleviation.    The PWings system will be developed initially for micro- and small- UAV military applications but the benefits and applications are relevant for all classes of UAVs.  As developed in Phase II the base system will provide enhanced stability a larger flight envelope and greater maneuverability to the SUAVs conducting SUAV-related missions viz. urban ISR and lethal engagement.  Ideal platforms would be smaller UAVs with severe weight and volumetric limitations those not capable of carrying gimbaled payloads for example.  SUAVs tend to be more affected by turbulence and wind speeds rendering onboard video above 20 knots useless and flight infeasible in wind speeds over 25 knots.  Mechanically stabilized video or even on-board digitally stabilized video greatly improves the military utility of ISR missions but as UAVs continue to decrease in size to support the squad and single soldier CONOPs integrating these payloads will be infeasible.  PWings will provide platforms such as the Aerovironment Raven and Wasp with an alternative stabilization method with a much smaller weight footprint.  In addition PWings would increase the wind ceiling for SUAVs over the typical limit of 20 knots allowing these assets to be used much more often.    With over 13000 Aerovironment Raven SUAVs built to-date  a per system cost of $250k  and a projected UAV sales of $1.8 billion over the next 10 years for “mini” and small tactical UAVs  SUAV enhancements is a lucrative market.  During fiscal 2011 the U.S. Army the largest Raven user increased its projected total demand for our Raven small UAS by 8% from 2182 to 2358 new systems.  One can look to the Raven DDL block upgrades as a model for the market potential of Program of Record system upgrades like PWings.  The Raven DDL retrofit kit was completed in fiscal year (fy) 2010 contributing to a UAS service revenue of $20.9 million in fy 2011 and increase in total UAS revenue of $13 million for a total of $224 million of fy 2011.

Aurora will develop accurate models for a range of aircraft concepts and test these concepts using advanced flight control methods in relevant gust and ship-deck tracking environments. Thus the Phase I effort will develop and demonstrate a flight control architecture for multi-flight-mode UAVs performing operations requiring precision hover agility. Development will be sufficient to enable Phase II prototype testing whose set-up will begin during the Phase I option.","N102-172-0423","N102-172","10.2",

The propulsion system will be an internal combustion (IC) engine installed in parallel with an electric motor system driving a single propeller.  We are leveraging Aurora’s experience using a design tool for design space exploration and multi-objective optimization for hybrid propulsion systems in UAV applications.  We will combine Aurora’s extensive UAV aircraft design experience with Mississippi State University’s automotive hybrid propulsion system design experience to provide a state-of-the-art UAV hybrid propulsion solution.  BENEFIT:  A hybrid propulsion system in a small UAV will allow the vehicle to operate with the benefits of both an IC engine (long endurance) and electric motor (quiet stealth) with proper design.  Once a hybrid propulsion system design process is established it could be applied to virtually any existing UAV for propulsion system retrofit.","F103-209-0692","AF103-209","10.3",

A problem is that current propulsion options provide either long endurance (internal combustion) or quiet operation (electric) but not both.  Hybridization of the powertrain incorporating both internal combustion and electric motor technology has the potential to meet these demands; however the complexity of its design and operation favors evaluation in the context of the aircraft and mission requirements.  For this reason in Phase I hybrid propulsion models were developed and integrated into an aircraft model to predict performance under a standardized flight profile.  Results indicated that the hybrid architecture was feasible but that further component technology development would be required before endurance capabilities matched current capabilities.  A Phase II program is proposed to mature the hybrid propulsion system concept through performance simulation using detailed component data system controller development hardware-in-the-loop simulation of the system and controller and a benchtop demonstration of system operation under a simulated mission profile using representative hardware.  The goal will be to demonstrate the operability of a hybrid propulsion system in a flight-like configuration to provide a solid foundation for further development of a flight-rated system.  BENEFIT:  The key contribution of a hybrid propulsion system is the capability to operate in a mode with the internal combustion engine off reducing the operating noise of the aircraft until the energy storage system needs recharged using the internal combustion engine.  This period of reduced operating noise will improve the survivability of small aircraft in a battle zone by making these aircraft less detectable.  Since these aircraft operate at low altitudes they are subjected to small arms fire and do not have the weight capacity to carry armor to survive attacks so reducing the detectability is the only option to improve their survivability.  The hybrid architecture and controller development and demonstration that will be performed during Phase II may be applied to a variety of small aircraft currently operated by the Army Navy and Marine Corps as well as to small organically designed aircraft that will be used by these services in the future.","F2-6469","AF103-209","10.3",

The solid-state nature of this flight control actuation scheme allows for scalability to miniature sizes as well as increases in overall reliability. The general approach to morphing flight control surfaces has been proven through the Phase I results. Aerodynamic predictions based on the experimental deflections have shown superior operation in every aerodynamic performance metric when compared to a servo-driven flapped airfoil design. Bench-top and wind-tunnel experiments show that the technology has the structural strength to support the operational loads and the actuators can be produced at a reasonable cost. The objective of this project is to advance the smart material actuator system to the point where it can be demonstrated on a representative platform at a size weight and power that will eliminate those questions as barriers to implementation on current and future micro air weapons and vehicles.  BENEFIT:  The proposed new flight control actuation technology can improve micro-UAVs by eliminating servos linkages and moving parts from the micro-air-vehicle. Servos are frequently identified as low reliability and problematic in the field; thus their removal can substantially increase performance and reliability while reducing size weight and power. The ultimate goal is a solid-state aircraft with no servos and airframes and control devices that can be stored for long periods of time with high probability of deployment success. The ability to apply this new technology to various air vehicle designs of scales is a key benefit. While the technology developed could be the basis for new vehicle designs further benefit could be realized through integration with existing micro air vehicles; by re-adapting or re-using current MAV technology. Because this technology has the potential to scale to a variety of sizes specifically to down to micro or nano scales the U.S. Air Force as well as other branches of the U.S. armed forces could benefit from this UAV solution that does not sacrifice performance. Micro or nano scale UAV technology that enables a MAV to navigate tight city streets could be of potential use to Home Land Security and local law enforcement agencies as well. Additionally at the conclusion of this effort we expect to have a validated set of design tools smart material concepts fabrication techniques and control electronics designs that our partners Boeing and Honeywell are interested in applying to their systems.","F2-5554","AF083-097","08.3",

The sensor will depend on new differential absorption radiometer (DAR) technology that will enable detection of multiple species while nearly perfectly correcting for interferences by atmospheric gases (such as water vapor) and various sources of clutter including aerosol scattering and variations in source emissivity.  A hard-wired signal processing circuitry will provide these corrections by subtraction and normalization at exceptionally low uncertainty of the signals detected by detector pairs.  The sensor is projected to achieve sensitivities matching or exceeding existing passive sensors while using low-energy low cost uncooled detectors.  The simple design and user-friendly output will allow easy telemetry (low data rate requirements).  These features will also allow implementation of the sensor for use by untrained personnel in domestic and military applications.  When using natural IR emission the detector will lend itself for packaging as a remote passive sensor or when combined with an artificial source as an in-situ sensor (e.g. for protection of public buildings).  Unique technology licensed exclusively to Avir will permit the extension of the sensor for imaging and for downwind hazard assessment. The sensor will be first designed for deployment on expandable UAVs. However its versatility low cost simplicity and robustness will allow it to be quickly modified for security applications such as: 1) handheld sensors for military personnel or domestic first responders; 2) stationary sensors for public facilities such as subway stations airports or government buildings; 3) airborne applications such as forward looking helicopter avionics; 4) hybridization with existing equipment such as DIAL and Fourier transform spectrometers for large field-of-view and rapid sensing; and more.  The sensor can also be packaged for non-security applications such as detection of natural gas leaks alcohol sensors for law enforcement applications or electrical fire detection.","N012-0044","N01-145","01.2",

The system can be electronically reconfigured to function as a: laser designator laser spot tracker laser range finder and a proximity sensor. This modular system occupies less than 4 cubic inches and has a range of 0.5 km—2.5 km in a slightly larger version. A passive Q-switched laser is used as the optical source. The high amount of pulse jitter of such lasers is reduced by more than an order of magnitude to acceptable levels through electronic and optical means. The reduced jitter is a result of rapid change of the laser cavity loss/gain and causes Q-switching to occur at a precisely defined time.

It’s small size low cost and extreme ruggedness also allows it to be used in SWaP constrained applications other than UAVs.

The proposed effort seeks to develop FAA-certifiable collision avoidance and separation assurance algorithms that guarantee safe interoperation of small UAVs and other aircraft in the NAS.  Small UAVs pose additional size weight and power (SWaP) limitations that make this problem especially difficult.  The proposed effort adapts and integrates two novel technologies.  A rapid collision avoidance algorithm first developed by MIT for unmanned ground vehicles is adapted and unified with an efficient hybrid D* path re-planning algorithm developed previously by the authors.  These technologies are chosen specifically for: (1) their robust real-time performance using very limited computation; (2) their accommodation of substantial sensor disturbance and modeling uncertainty; and (3) their generation of maneuvers that are guaranteed to be dynamically feasible.  The proposed concept is designed to handle dynamic obstacle aircraft that may or may not be cooperative or well-sensed.  Because the collision-avoidance and path-planning components both generate complete realizable trajectories (rather than waypoints) tracking errors can be bounded and aircraft separation can be assured with the highest levels of confidence.","N081-079-0593","N08-079","08.1",

The problems are magnified for unmanned aircraft given typical vehicle sizes actuator bandwidth and the absence of a pilot. The goal of our research is to develop the control technologies that enable unmanned aerial vehicles to perform flight-envelope protection and upset recovery autonomously. Reinforcement learning control is a core technology to design outer-loop controllers that affect situation-appropriate recovery within the problem constraints (structural loads for example). Manual recovery practices and NATOPS procedures are also encoded in the design. Novel control devices can make air vehicles more resistant to departure by postponing the onset of flow separation at high angles of attack.

Current-generation controllers are already reaching a level of complexity that pushes the envelopes of existing V&V approaches with little hope for affordable V&V of next-generation intelligent systems.  One possible solution is to combine run-time monitors for subsystem components with simple backup modules that provide a safe reversionary mode during undesirable conditions.  Such an architecture allows the V&V to be partitioned into design-time V&V (for the relatively simple monitor and fail-safe subsystems) and run-time V&V (for the full complex controller).

The autonomy required by such assets combined with the elevation of many mission-critical applications to flight-critical status levies significant additional requirements for flight-critical computing and sensor hardware. Current approaches to this problem focus on integrating flight- and mission-critical software in order to avoid unnecessary replication of computer hardware. Sensors however remain unaddressed and require significant redundancy. Barron Associates will address this problem with two novel approaches to fault tolerance:  cooperative redundancy and fractional redundancy. Cooperative redundancy allows a healthy aircraft to provide sensor data to a proximal aircraft that has experienced a sensor failure; fractional redundancy exploits analytical redundancy amongst sensors to reconstruct the value nominally supplied by a failed sensor.  In the proposed research effort Barron Associates will demonstrate cooperative redundancy by simulating an unmanned aircraft aiding another unmanned aircraft crippled by a sensor failure during the autoland flight phase. Barron Associates will also develop a general architecture for fractional redundancy and characterize the sensors to which both approaches are applicable.  BENEFIT:  Barron Associates anticipates a number of opportunities to apply this SBIR-developed technology to DoD programs. The DoD has a clear need for affordable unmanned assets that can integrate with current manned assets. Hardware replication poses a challenge for affordability yet single-string sensor suites offer insufficient reliability for flight-critical operations. Technologies like cooperative and fractional redundancy which reduce hardware costs while maintaining suitable levels of reliability address this challenge and will help the DoD meet its need for affordable reliable UAVs.  Another evident application of the proposed fault-tolerance techniques is for manned aircraft. Fractional redundancy in particular has the potential to provide greatly improved failure isolation and recovery for critical sensors. Other potential uses of the proposed fault-tolerance technologies are in the areas of civilian UAVs intended to operate in the National Airspace as well as civilian manned aircraft.  Last fractional redundancy will offer the automotive sector cost reductions while maintaining overall sensor-suite reliability.  There is an increasing trend in the automotive sector towards digital control systems for stability augmentation braking to four-wheel steering etc. which will require reliable information from a diverse set of sensors.","F093-005-1639","AF093-005","09.3",

In critical avoidance scenarios UASs in autonomous flight do not currently employ the same level of situational awareness and decision-making offered by a human pilot in a manned aircraft.  A number of research groups have been working to develop sensors and algorithms to provide UASs with an autonomous sense and avoid (SAA) capability.  Many of these approaches are based on extrapolating trajectories of nearby vehicles from current and recent state measurements.  An opportunity exists to enhance the effectiveness of current SAA technologies in the terminal area by leveraging knowledge from sources such as published procedures current conditions and ATC instructions in addition to the current trajectories of nearby aircraft.  Barron Associates proposes a Phase I research effort to develop intent analysis algorithms that combine run-time observations with prior models of expected behavior based on detailed knowledge of standard terminal area operating procedures.  The proposed approach will use statistically rigorous methods to detect when aircraft are violating the rules so that intent predictions can be revised accordingly.  The result will be reliable detection of conflicts with low false alarm rates.  BENEFIT:  The proposed intent prediction methods represent a key enabling technology for integrating UASs into terminal area operations both in the national airspace and in war zones.  Safely integrating UASs in airspace with manned vehicles as well as other unmanned craft will greatly expand the missions that can be performed by UASs both for military and non-military operators.  The greater autonomy afforded by the technology will also reduce operator workload allowing an operator to manage more vehicles and/or perform higher level tasks such as analyzing data collected by an UAS.  The potential market for the technology is quite large.  As of 2008 the Department of Defense was reported to have nearly 6000 UASs in its inventory and the number continues to increase.  Any of these vehicles that operate from airfields potentially shared with other air vehicles (most medium and large UASs and some small vehicles) will benefit from the technology.","F103-007-2183","AF103-007","10.3",

In flight control systems free-play specifications are set conservatively in order to preclude free-play-induced LCO.  However conservative free-play requirements can increase the manufacturing cost of actuators and give rise to a costly program of regular inspections.  Given the impracticality of experimentally determining appropriate free-play limits an analytical method to safely relax free-play specifications could reduce actuator manufacturing and lifecycle costs.   Importantly in addition to accurate aeroelastic modeling to predict LCO proven adaptive control methods exist to mitigate the effects of uncertain actuator nonlinearities such as free-play.  Thus maximum benefit would be derived from a tool that combines improved aeroelastic modeling that explicitly addresses uncertainty effects with adaptive control techniques to relax free-play criteria and mitigate the adverse closed-loop effects of actuator free-play. Barron Associates Inc. ZONA Technologies Inc. Dr. Earl Dowell and Dr. Gang Tao propose a Phase II effort that leverages team members'' expertise in aeroelastic modeling and adaptive control in the presence of uncertainty to develop and demonstrate Advanced Modeling and Control for Aeroservoelastic Design (AMCAD) - a software tool to facilitate the case-by-case analysis of free-play specifications.     BENEFIT:   Improved techniques for understanding the effects of uncertainty free-play and adaptive control on aeroservoelastic stability have potential applications to most air vehicles including military fixed-wing aircraft UAVs and commercial and general aviation aircraft.  Thus the AMCAD Toolbox and the underlying technologies will have widespread military and commercial applicability.","F2-4858","AF081-086","08.1",

Barron Associates is teaming with Nielsen Engineering (NEAR) to investigate options for dynamically determining store launch release parameters.  The off-line method will utilize NEAR’s STRLNCH application to build a look-up table as a function of a number of relevant parameters which will be queried on-line to derive the correct settings. The on-line method will solve for the optimal solution on-line using as its simulation engine a modified version of STRLNCH.  The hybrid method will combine the two approaches.  The optimal release parameters are a function of the flight conditions as well as the store properties bomb rack location and the aircraft.  The off-line approach will be implemented and tested for execution time to insure robustness and to verify that the correct release parameters are determined.  An investigation will be made of appropriate cost functions to insure aircraft safety and maximize mission success probability.  In addition the system architecture requirements to support the proposed solution will be examined with a focus on the interfaces between the aircraft the bomb rack and the store.  BENEFIT:  Software algorithms and the necessary supporting architecture are being developed here to allow online modification of the pitch angle and ejection forces for releasing a store from an aircraft.  This technology will have benefits for a broad selection of store launch applications from munitions delivery to flare release. The algorithms will be designed and tested with multiple airframe/store combinations including fighters bombers helicopters and UAV’s. As such the technology will be a benefit to all the major branches of the military.. The architecture is applicable to a large range of stores/munitions and bomb-racks opening up the potential applications of the technology to include release of store countermeasures supply pod release as well as munitions delivery.  For example the proposed technology can enhance Countermeasures Dispenser Systems such as the AN/ALE-47 which already uses threat information from the aircraft to determine a flare dispersion pattern.  Another potential market for the technology is UAV/UAS delivered stores.  The success of using UAVs for missions such as troop resupply in a combat zone depends critically on autonomous on-board store-release operation.  Greater flexibility for this sort of mission would be provided by allowing the store launch settings to be adjustable during the mission.","F112-098-2045","AF112-098","11.2",

As engineers provide UAVs with more autonomy manpower requirements decrease.  But increased autonomy replaces judgment with heuristics. It often degrades the remaining human performance. Balance is needed.  Phase I demonstrates the feasibility of using game technology to find this balance.  “Avant Guard” models a mission with multiple small UAVs. This game simulates look-ahead convoy protection in a hostile urban situation. The game has clear value as a research instrument. Its cognitive challenges are organized into simple tasks. Each task fits cleanly into an overall model of autonomous behavior.   Each task is independently automated – at precisely defined levels. Calibrated to established standards they are easily compared to one another and to the findings of other researchers. Besides this range of static levels the experimenter can assign an adaptive mechanism to any task. Several distinct natural mechanisms are provided. Alternatively the researcher may choose to develop an original adaptive mechanism by supplying simple rules to a finite state machine. Avant Guard enables new research in cognitive engineering. The result will be design patterns that promote responsive interplay between man and autonomous entities.

Most hyperspectral imaging systems sacrifice spatial resolution for spectral resolution.  As a result the imagery that contains spectral information which may be important in target selection will not have the spatial resolution to allow simultaneous detection of objects by shape-based algorithms or human-in the-loop exploitation.    This project is directed towards the development of a multiplexed hyperspectral imager suitable for deployment on a Tier 2 UAV.  In Phase I we were able to develop hardware and software for the creation of high-resolution hyperspectral images by using a scanning fore-optic an array of apertures and a dispersive optical processor.  The prototype system demonstrated in Phase produces composite LWIR hyperspectral images at the resolution of the focal plane array by combining images from varying scan positions processed with custom software.    The great promise demonstrated in Phase 1 will be scaled up in Phase 2 with a much faster focal plane array integrated cooling system and a dedicated computer with integrated data acquisition and processing software with a user-friendly GUI allowing the production of high resolution LWIR hyperspectral images at 5 Hz.      BENEFIT:  The multiplexed scanning hyperspectral imager allows the production of LWIR hyperspectral images with simultaneously high spatial and spectral resolution.  This will allow the integration of spectral and shape-based detection algorithms in a single system for greatly enhanced target identification and discrimination.","F2-6832","AF112-158","11.2",

This device when retrofitted to an existing IR camera will add the capability of switching from high-resolution IR imaging mode to a polarimetric IR imaging mode.  This will allow the acquisition of an image containing the full polarization state of the light in a single camera frame thus allowing the detection of fast moving objects or of making observations from a rapidly moving platform such as an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

This form of propulsion is currently in use in marine applications and has been studied by major aircraft manufacturers and the military.

This effort will capitalize on computer control to provide a universal pitch cycloidal propeller that will allow efficient flight across a wide range of flight speeds and conditions. Cycloidal propulsion provides a unique 360-degree directional flight capability through use of a low-velocity high-volume flow technique of exceptional efficiency.

This proposal focuses on the problem of identifying events of interest from video cameras upstream of telemetry on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). More video camera data is generated on Class I UAVs than can be transmitted under battle conditions in real time and in a form that operators and analysts on the ground can readily understand. Data are typically transmitted at the rate of up to 30 frames per second with each frame containing up to 12 megapixels of data. Typical video compression algorithms like H.264 compress each frame globally by a factor of about eight to one but substantially more compression is needed. Brainlike has a patented smart sensing process based on automatic and adaptive (auto-adaptive) processing. During auto-adaptive processing expected background clutter is identified and masked while unexpected and/or interesting activity is marked as windows of information within each frame.

To make these applications successful two main technical challenges must be addressed: (1) dynamic highly mobile network technologies to provide reliable time-critical exchange of the network's media and (2) information management and control system technologies to enable the networked UAVs to function as an integrated system to accomplish designated military or commercial missions.  Rigorous solutions in these areas would provide the technological foundation for Intelligent Networks. The objective of this project is to assist the Office of Naval Research in making significant forward strides in these technology areas by conducting a Phase I feasibility and tradeoff study to research and then recommend optimal solutions for state-of-the-art dynamic mobile network technologies. This effort will involve exploring a wide range of advanced decision support systems (along with their application methodologies) and offering recommendations on an optimal solution to provide information management and control systems for the dynamic network. The research and recommendations provided by this study will provide the foundation for a follow-on Phase II proposal.  Dynamic highly-mobile UAV networks combined with effective efficient and responsive decision support systems providing a variable degree of autonomous control for a wide range of mission functions will enable commanders to leverage the synergistic benefits achievable by a combination of sensors communications nodes and weapon systems deployable by a network of UAVs minimizing threats to manned tactical reconnaissance surveillance or transport aircraft. The technical capabilities identified in this proposal will also significantly enhance and directly address established requirements of U.S. Special Operations forces - specifically operational requirements now extant for reconnaissance surveillance and other support functions that could be provided by such Intelligent Networks. Significant commercial applications also exist for Intelligent Networks possessing the ability to gather and distribute a wide range of media and rapidly adapt to changing circumstances based upon a pre-established set of rules or body of expertise.

It is further assumed that there are no costs in terms of dollars or in terms of general safety incurred by not allowing UAVs to fly.  There are however significant costs incurred by not using UAVs for domestic missions and these costs can be quantified so that they can be considered as offsets for equipment or operational changes required to safely fly UAVs with general aviation.  The FAA has indicated that before certifying a UAV for flight the UAV must be capable of collision avoidance in such a way as to be indistinguishable from a human operator.

This effort aims to provide a solution for UAVs to interact with manned aircraft through standard voice radio.   Manned aircraft routinely communicate their position and intended maneuvers over voice radios so improve situational awareness of those they share airspace with.  Since UAVs cannot understand natural language radio transmissions a new type of radio direction finder will be used to locate aircraft based on short voice radio transmissions.  The UAV will be outfitted with a standard radio modified to broadcast the UAVs position and intended maneuvers.  Additionally the UAV will broadcast a request for response from nearby aircraft.  These responses will allow the UAV to radio locate and if needed track the aircraft in the vicinity.

For example an increasing number of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) are serving the military commercial and research markets today. However these systems are generally limited to supporting a single particular sensor payload or concept of operation assigned at the design stage of development. Expansion of their capabilities or the integration of a newly developed subsystem often requires a redesign. The Unmanned Systems community could benefit from the development and commercialization of an Unmanned System that is truly adaptable to many payloads and missions. We propose the development of an Unmanned Aerial System capable of supporting a variety of sensors weapons and concepts of operations through a modular payload bays and payload interface design. Our modular payload bays and payload interface will allow the UAS to support missions with varying endurance and payload needs via interchangeable subsections capable of supporting extra fuel batteries sensors or ordinance. By utilizing a systems engineering approach drawing on years of UAS design experience and focusing on providing an adaptable system our design will be able to provide a cost-effective solution for a large variety of payloads customers and missions.    BENEFIT: Military border surveillance groups search and rescue teams and researchers could all benefit from an affordable UAS with long endurance and modular payload capabilities. For instance the low cost UAS could be equipped with a laser illuminator and be flown into high risk areas to aid soldiers during night operations or be configured to carry large amounts of fuel and a small sensor to provide persistent surveillance over a specific area or along convoy routes. With the United States Homeland Security already capitalizing on larger Unmanned Systems this system can fly non lethal directed energy payloads to deter illegal immigrants as they cross the border. Moreover a gimbal with geo-location software could be flown onboard an asset loaded with fuel to search for hikers lost in the mountains. Researchers and scientists could also benefit from the development of a system specifically designed to ease their payload integration and logistics needs allowing them to remain focused on the science and not the platform. Furthermore a long endurance platform would allow researchers to capture more data in a single flight without the increased risks associated with multiple launch and recoveries. In summary a highly versatile low cost small UAS is needed to interact with multiple payloads for a variety of missions with the capability to operate over an extended period of time. Our proposed system will be able to fill this capability gap effectively meeting the needs of the Unmanned Systems market on cost and on time.","F083-006-0016","AF083-006","08.3",

Sensor data obtained from current gunship operations is limited by stand-off distance constraints the resolution of onboard sensors and the inability to see below the weather to the objective area.  A system solution is needed that can increase the capabilities of current Air Force operations by supporting varying sensor capabilities safely and in an affordable manner. An Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) that can be deployed from a manned host aircraft is an ideal solution to this capability gap. An air-launched UAS can capitalize on the long-range fast response capabilities of the host aircraft while also providing agile and minimal detection sensor data collection signaling ground sensor delivery and threat elimination after deployment from the host aircraft.  The proposed design will fill the current capability gap for Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and strike capabilities immediately and affordably by employing an assortment of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) sub-systems modular payload support a well-supported host aircraft integration and deployment plan and innovative manufacturing techniques.  BENEFIT:  Military and civilian personnel could utilize the proposed air deployed UAS as an additional tool in the performance of their services. The UAS integrates seamlessly into the existing manned aircraft infrastructure and therefore complements the capabilities of the military and civilian users. For instance the UAS developed under this effort could be deployed from a manned aircraft and be flown into high risk areas to aid soldiers during night operations. The UAS would permit the manned aircraft to stay out of harms way by providing persistent surveillance over a specific area or along convoy routes. This system can also loiter along border regions to collect data for Homeland Security groups with limited manned aircraft assets and limited situational awareness. Moreover the UAS could be deployed from a US Forest Service manned platform to search for ideal locations for fire breaks or from Search and Rescue helicopters to locate hikers lost in rugged terrain. In summary the highly versatile small UAS has the potential to perform a variety of missions over an extended period of time complementing the existing capabilities of manned aircraft.","F2-6957","AF083-006","08.3",

Low-latency display is critical to minimize the control problem of "oversteering" the UAV that results if the UAV operator relies on out-of-date imagery to make control decisions.  The prototype will demonstrate the feasibility of developing a deployable software package meeting the Navy's UAV requirements and compatible with the TCS operating environment.      In this document we outline: a set of technical objectives for the Phase I prototype; a software architectural design of the prototype; and a project plan to achieve the objectives.  We also outline a Phase I Option that addresses the prototyping of features not directly related to the fundamental issue of low-latency display indexing and recording.      Innovations in this system include: (i) a deterministic low-latency data pathway for video decoding and (ii) a powerful and flexible motion imagery data storage schema that allows diverse metadata to be indexed at receive-time while video is being decoded with low latency.   The commercial market for the technologies to be developed under this proposal is sizable.  It includes: (i) the market for video from military and scientific UAVs; (ii) the civilian market for MPEG-based video surveillance recording systems for banks casinos airports and public transit; and (iii) searchable MPEG-based video databases of highlight films for professional college and high-school sports teams.","N022-0905","N02-159","02.2",

The technical challenges are how to design a curved substrate with radius of curvature of 1 in and FOV of 40 degrees suitable for sensor integration how to pattern the TFT pixel readout circuit on such curved substrate and how to integrate a photodetector array on the curved TFT backpanel plate. In Phase I we will develop a top-sensing polymer photodetector with spectral response from 400 nm to 900+ nm capable of being integrated onto the curved substrate. We will design a curved substrate meeting the program’s specification. We will demonstrate the feasibility of making metal oxide TFTs and active matrix image pixels on the curved substrate. Continuing into Phase II we will develop a photodetector covering wavelength from 300nm to beyond 1400nm and we will design and develop a sensor array on the curved substrate.  BENEFIT:  We expect that the completion of the proposed work would have an immediate impact on military and commercial applications. By developing a VIS-NIR-SWIR sensor array on a curved substrate the complex optics system to convert a curved field-of-view (FOV) into a flat focal plane array could be avoided. As a result the volume weight and expense of the objective optics which used to make it extremely difficult for the installation of such sensor system into applications where weight and space are critical are no longer the issue. Those benefits are not only beneficial to the military applications such as HM and small UVA but also to the commercial applications such as cameras embedded in consumer electronics homeland security and automobile navigation.","F112-017-1168","AF112-017","11.2",

These sensors will utilize a proprietary Centeye vision chip capable of acquiring images at multiple resolutions and frame rates. The sensors developed will be production ready for commercialization. We will refine and harden the sensor firmware via extensive testing in real-world environments. We will integrate the sensor onto an air vehicle and perform two demonstrations: In Year 1 we will fly the FAS on a rotary-wing MAV and demonstrate the ability of the sensor to acquire and track moving targets. In Year 2 we will insert the FAS in the control loop of the MAV to demonstrate the ability to additionally pursue and possibly collide with the target. Primary deliverables include FAS sensors a development kit with libraries upgraded enabling the user to create their own applications and a wide field of view multiaperture imaging system based on these sensors.  BENEFITS: The technology developed will be useful for a wide range of applications in micro air vehicles (MAVs) unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and robotics in general. The developed hardware will utilize a combined hardware and software approach that facilitates the detection and tracking of moving objects obstacle detection and general optical flow processing. When properly inserted onto MAVs the resulting technology could improve obstacle avoidance adequately to enable autonomous flight down an urban canyon while avoiding both larger obstacles (buildings full trees) and smaller obstacles (poles cables etc.). The resulting technology could also facilitate the detection of moving targets in the area such as persons ground vehicles or other air vehicles. The combined hardware and software approach will reduce demands on the image processor allowing these capabilities to be ultimately performed with a weight budget of two grams or less per sensor. Note that our definition of "sensor" is a single board that includes optics imager processor memory and all other active or passive components enabling the board to act as a self-contained machine vision system. The same technology could be adapted for use in both ground and underwater robotics for both civilian and military applications. Civilian applications would range from toys and consumer robotics (e.g. vacuum cleaners etc.) to more sophisticated commercial robots. The development kit will allow an end-user to develop their own sensor firmware/algorithms and facilitate the integration of the technology into their own products or systems.","F2-4771","AF081-051","08.1",

A wide-area/over-the-horizon C2 Data Link has been needed for some time to physically de-couple the UAVs from their RCSs.

Our sensor exploits novel features of AC electrokinetics available only at the nanoscale to detect signatures of TICs rapidly and with high sensitivity. The label-free approach eliminates critical difficulties associated with reagent logistics and stability.  During Phase I we successfully demonstrated proof-of-principle of CFDRC’s FIND-IT sensor technology. A judicious combination of physics-based analysis and experimentation was used to demonstrate that Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) can be used for rapid (~seconds–minutes) detection of TICs/TIMs at low (sub-ppm level) concentrations. In combination small electrode spacing and SAM modified electrodes can be used to obtain unprecedented sensitivity of detection (down to ppb level or lower). During Phase II the design and performance specifications for the nanoimpedance based TIC/TIM sensor element will be further refined. The optimized sensor element design(s) will be microfabricated and laboratory tested to delineate sensor performance (in particular sensitivity and specificity). Subsequently an integrated FIND-IT sensor system prototype will be developed by integrating the sensor element along with CFDRC-developed and COTS micro- and nano- components. Integration and engineering will be guided by the need to develop a fieldable prototype with the constraints on hand-portability ruggedness remote operation and UAV/UGV mountability. The integrated FIND-IT sensor will be experimentally demonstrated for the detection of a suite of TICs.  ","D2-0784","SB072-001","07.2",

Systems that provide this function can be grouped in terms of their capability which determines to a great degree their application. There is increasing motivation for reducing the assembly integration and test (AI/T) of optical systems. The development of E-O sensor payloads has been historically resource intensive for a variety of reasons. One powerful driving force behind the expense is that the manufacturing technology required to achieve the performance requirements leaves little room for alignment tolerances. One potential method of addressing this sensitivity to alignment tolerances is to design and build optical systems using computational imaging principles; converting from a simple imaging system into a signal processing system.  BENEFIT:  Reduction in cost and increase in performance for commercial optical systems (e.g. digital camera manufactures digital video camera manufacturers remote sensing system vendors).  Reduction in cost and increase in performance for government/military systems (e.g. E-O payloads for space UAV or manned aircraft platforms).","F103-118-0730","AF103-118","10.3",

The solution will scale easily from one to multiple sensors with minimal effort. This will allow a wider variety of missions to be executed without major refitting.

However monitoring video imagery from an aerial platform is often challenging due to poor image quality and other issues which reduce image interpretability such as platform/sensor instability target size and environmental artifacts. These issues can make it difficult or impossible to discover and monitor important targets and events. To address this problem we propose a suite of algorithms called Video and Image Enhancement Workbench for Aerial Surveillance and Tracking (VIEW-FAST). VIEW-FAST consists of four modules: (1) image correction to correct blur and boost contrast (2) image stabilization to compensate for camera shake (3) super-resolution to reveal fine scene details and (4) target tracking to reduce the burden on the operators attention and allow multi-tasking. This system will increase sensor operator effectiveness in ISR and CAS-TIC missions making them more successful and reducing personnel requirements.

For the Navy to incorporate these vehicles into its critical missions there has to be an efficient protocol to handle them on the decks of aircraft carriers. Current handling approaches and procedures have substantial limitations. For example GPS-based taxiing via pre-set coordinates assumes that the area is clear of all other traffic while joystick remote control is cumbersome and relies on specially trained personnel. Although an elaborate  sensor network positioned on the deck could alleviate these problems its cost would be prohibitively high.  We propose to develop a UAV-based intelligent navigation system that relies solely on image cues. Our sensor suite will be configured using commercial off-the-shelf video cameras and mounted in the nose section of the UAV. The cameras have small form factors and support both daytime and nighttime operation. The video processor consists of object detection tracking and range estimation modules. These low-level modules support two higher level functions-recognizing taxiing gestures given by a human controller and path planning for obstacle avoidance. An intelligent controller fuses information from these modules with scenario knowledge to achieve robust situation assessment throughout the UAV's taxiing.    The intelligent vision-based command recognition and navigation system developed under this effort would find immediate use in numerous defense and civilian scenarios. Examples include operating robotic vehicles in hazardous or dangerous environments and emergency management (finding survivors in wreckages). Initiatives to provide UAV access to the national airspace such the UAV National Industry Team (UNITE) have already identified the need for this type of vision technology.

In this proposal we present a navigation system capable of estimating a 6-degree of freedom state vector purely from optical sensor input. The system Motion Imagery Navigation Using Terrain Estimates (MINUTE) is capable of estimating the state (position and orientation) of an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) given a (optional) initial state estimate an existing terrain elevation map and an image sequence generated by an onboard sensor. This system first reconstructs a relative terrain map from pairs of images taken by a single camera on the UAV as it flies over terrain. The reconstructed terrain map is then matched against existing elevation data to produce an accurate geo-referenced estimate of the state of the vehicle. In Phase I we will design a working MINUTE prototype study algorithm sensitivity using an existing synthetic data generation package and address the real-time system requirements.  Optical-based navigation state estimation is relevant to any autonomous system moving through a complicated environment.

Here we focus on information fusion with respect to: 1) assessing the battlespace situation with respect to overall mission requirements; 2) determining the information needs based on high-level user-generated requirements; and 3) translating the information needs into high-level cluster specific tasking. We propose to develop a Multi Agent-based Satellite System for Information Fusion (MASSIF). The innovation is the application of computational intelligence techniques such as fuzzy logic and Bayesian belief networks with distributed agent technology and messaging for information fusion in distributed systems such as spacecraft clusters. We see considerable potential for this approach in enhancing cluster management control. The proposed technology will directly support and augment present and future autonomous systems involving multiple spacecraft UAVs and underwater submersibles. It is also applicable to complex systems such as power plants that possess distributed components which require reconfiguration and monitoring. The core technology complements various ongoing projects including a current effort sponsored by NASA to build a distributed environment for spacecraft onboard planning and scheduling. We also plan to generalize the agent to embed in our Intelligent Agent Toolkit for use in any domain requiring intelligent agent interaction.","F021-1207","AF02-062","02.1",

However the Air Force frequently needs to fly UAS missions covertly using emissions control procedures precluding the use of transponder-based systems or radar for collision avoidance. Most passive sensors however do not have the ability to “see through” clouds and other visual obscurants necessitating flights to remain within visual meteorological conditions (VMC). To address this need we propose a system based on passive sensing to detect and avoid clouds called Image-based Navigation for Cloud Avoidance (INCA). INCA performs cloud detection in either visible or long wave infrared imagery using a combination of motion color and texture cues. To enable navigation the system goes beyond simple 2D image detection and estimates 3D range information using structure from motion. When the current flight path violates VMC minima a path replanning algorithm based on A* uses the 3D information to compute alternate flight paths. A closed-loop evaluation framework incorporating a flight simulator tests cloud detection performance over a range of operating conditions and tests the efficacy of avoidance maneuvers.","F081-087-0126","AF081-087","08.1",

Furthermore the technological and information advances of Network Centric Warfare (NCW) have resulted in an explosion in the complexity and sheer quantity of information that is available to the operator. To counter this increasingly complex operational environment the Navy requires advanced human/system interface concepts that will make optimal use of the operator's cognitive resources and minimize potential for operator error. The adaptive interface should enhance the flow of information and control between the operator and the vehicle to improve the operator's situation awareness (SA) and decision-making performance while alleviating workload and reducing the effects of cognitive biases and thus improving survivability lethality and ultimately mission effectiveness.

One reason for this is the difficulty of creating lightweight distortion-free wide-angle optics.  Instead of attempting to recreate the entire visual field at high resolution we propose to present a small high-resolution foveal image to one eye and a larger lower-acuity peripheral image to the other.  This combination loosely mimics the human eye in which high visual acuity is present only in the narrow foveal region.  By limiting high-resolution imagery to only the foveal image the wide-angle peripheral optics can be greatly simplified.   To determine if this “dichoptic vision system” (DiVS) can be used effectively we propose to build benchtop and head-aimed DiVS demonstrators using COTS components.  The demonstrators will be used to evaluate design concepts leading to a lightweight wearable DiVS prototype to be built in Phase II.  A reference binocular system (RBS) will also be designed.   We will also design a set of human subjects experiments including tasks representative of those performed by pilots ground vehicle drivers dismounted soldiers and EOD robot operators.  Our experimental plan will be submitted to one or more Institutional Review Boards for approval of performance in Phase II.     BENEFIT:  DARPA’s MANTIS program would specifically benefit from this effort’s hardware designs and experimental plan.  A well-designed foveal/peripheral dichoptic vision system would also open up new capabilities for the display industry and enable HMD users to have much better situational awareness while also retaining the high visual acuity necessary for their primary tasks.  All applications which require operators to view the world indirectly will benefit from this system.  Specific examples include remote piloting of UAVs ground vehicle driving using sensory inputs and EOD robot operation.  If coupled to a head-aimed camera system the benefits can be even further increased.  The gaming and home entertainment markets could also benefit as they constantly strive to improve their reproduction of the visible world.  ","F093-018-0660","AF093-018","09.3",

Toward this end the Navy is setting a UAV requirement to recognize the hand signals that directors (or Yellow Shirts) currently use to direct manned aircraft. We are proposing an approach that will minimally change deck procedures but should produce reliable hand signal recognition in essentially any weather and operating conditions. Our approach will rely on light-weight motion sensors and a communication device worn by the Yellow Shirts that will allow them to control the movements of all the UAV onboard the carrier.  The focus of our Phase I effort will be on building motion detection instrumentation for the Yellow Shirts and demonstrating that we can recognize and discriminate hand signals based on the motion detector output.  We will also demonstrate that we can use our interpretation of a Yellow Shirt's hand signals to control a UAV surrogate (i.e. a mobile robot in a laboratory environment).  Two different commercialization strategies can be envision for this technology. The first involves controlling the taxiing behavior of UAVs in tight quarters such as an aircraft carrier deck although this type of control may also be desirable on ground bases.  Another potential market is the training of military or civilian directors in a much safer environment. A PC based console could provide a low cost simulator that would help directors practice theirs signaling skills.  Direct feedback would indicate if the signals are performed correctly and emergency situations that come up rarely on a flight deck could be staged.  A related use might be the testing of new hand signals or signaling devices in a controlled environment.","N033-0191","N03-T003","03  ",

HORUS encodes the signals from a 1-dimensional RF antenna array onto the broad optical bandwidth   of a femtosecond comb laser as pulse compressed optical modulations using a  multichannel acousto-optic tunable filter  and then uses these modulated waveforms to encode the pulse-by-pulse range correlations  with a similarly encoded reference  in the volume of a photorefractive crystal as a 2-dimensional array of reflection holograms.  A swept frequency laser reads out this volume reflection hologram  and Fourier transformation by a lens onto a detector array provides  angle-of-arrival (eg multiple beamforming) and Doppler focusing   with Fourier transformation across frames yielding high dynamic-range   complex range profiles for each AOA/Doppler bin.  HORUS can operate with arbitrary radar waveforms with agile pulse-to-pulse variations  can switch between active and passive radar modes using transmitters of opportunity  and has the capability for MIMO processing using multiple tranmitters in  combination with the 1-D receive array.  Volume holographic radar correlation processing combined with AOA/Doppler focusing   will provide an enabling technology for ubiquitous multibeam radars on platforms like UAVs.    BENEFIT:  Unlike any previous holographic radar processors HORUS can be used in either a multibeam ubiquitous radar system or a passive multistatic radar system. A radar system equipped with HORUS could use a stealthy passive multistatic radar when operating in densely populated areas with many illuminators of opportunity or jammers and it could use an active monostatic radar when operating in remote areas with no illuminators of opportunity. A fully-functional HORUS system could offer all of these properties within a single implementation using COTS equipment.     Other range-Doppler processors including previous holographic and CCD-based interferometric approaches can produce 1000 range bins and 1000 Doppler bins. To this capability the HORUS system adds the capability for parallel multi-beam TTD beamforming with up to 1000 parallel beams and an additional 30 dB of beamformer processing gain. This is enabled by harnessing the third dimension of a volume hologram for signal processing and not just for multiplexing as in holographic optical data storage.  This range-Doppler processing across 1000 simultaneous AOA beams allows an active radar system to monitor up to 1000 regions on the ground with enormous dwell times and sensitivities.  In a multistatic radar system the system can perform parallel Doppler correlations for up to 1000 different transmitters a feature which can have a dramatic impact on the detection and resolution of the system.       A third feature is that these correlations are performed on arbitrary optically-upconverted RF signals without an RF receiver.  Arbitrary waveform processing allows monostatic radars to transmit dynamic radar pulses without reconfiguring the receiver and— even more significantly— it allows passive multistatic radars to use whatever signals are available without reconfiguring the receiver.  Thus the passive radar could conceivably work with the entire spectrum of FM broadcasters TV broadcasts and cellular phone transmitters simultaneously if the RF signals could be collected.     And finally the HORUS system can process RF bandwidths of 100 MHz or more using detectors and digitizers of 1 MHz or less— not the 200 MHz digitizers required by DSP systems. Slower digitizers are available with higher dynamic range so the HORUS system could use 16-bit or even 20–24-bit digitizers instead of 8–12-bit digitizers; this improves the detector dynamic range to 96 dB or more. Moreover the HORUS system performs the Doppler signal processing and beamforming before it digitizes the signal on a high dynamic range detector.  This dramatically enhances the clutter-limited dynamic range and the direct-transmitters-limited dynamic range of the active and passive radars respectively.    ","F2-6623","AF10-BT29","10.B",

Cloud Cap is the maker of the Piccolo autopilot which is used in many UAV systems including the prototype of the Coyote.  In the spring of 2006 Cloud Cap will introduce a new product the TASE stabilized pan tilt zoom camera system for small UAVs.  TASE is almost small enough to fit in the Coyote as is.  Our proposal is to modify the TASE to reduce its cost and size for the Coyote.  In addition we also propose as an option to develop a combined autopilot and gimbal electronics package in which the autopilot and gimbal controller are a single PCB.  This novel approach leverages heavily off of Cloud Cap's proven expertise in autopilots and our existing gimbal product development to deliver an integrated solution that will dramatically reduce the overall size and cost of the electronics of the Coyote.","N053-138-0449","N05-138","05.3",

Our efforts culminated in a multi-day demonstration in Yuma where we successfully completed a series of autonomous flights that conclusively demonstrated the feasibility of our hardware and software architecture for use in small UAVs. In phase II we plan to continue development on the Piccolo system in order to add more capability and flexibility to the system.  The development will pursue three main objects:   1) Integration of improved sensor suite including MEMS gyros and 3 axis Magnetometer - This enhancement will facilitate extended operations in GPS denied environments; and improved flight control performance.   2) Development of a Piccolo compatible generator and power conditioning system - This will facilitate extended duration operations and enhance our payload capability.  3) Development of auto land and auto takeoff capabilities - With the additions of the upgraded sensors these important features can now be realized minimizing the need for skilled pilots.   Initially the Piccolo II will be used as the primary flight controller on the AINS and SWARM UAV platforms. Target volumes for these vehicles may go as high as 10000 per year.  While the Navy applications are themselves worthy market opportunities we feel there are many other emerging applications where the Piccolo II's small size and reasonable cost will be an enabler.  These include civil as well as military reconnaissance routine and targeted weather observations and disaster assessment (forest fires floods and other inhospitable environments).  This feeling is based on the recent success of our Piccolo autopilot platform that has generated over $300000 in product sales in the latter half of last year.  The feedback we've received leads us to believe that a more advanced system such as the Piccolo II will have many takers. Our current Piccolo customers which include the Navy Air Force NASA AAI Titan Systems Advanced Ceramics Research and many university programs are interested in similar hardware solutions that leverage off of the existing Piccolo code base and development tools but have increased capability.","N2-0693","N01-147","01.1",

Their potential for small size and low cost has been offset by the lack of sufficient avionics hardware and software integration resulting in expensive vehicles that are difficult to maintain and suffer from high rates of attrition.  The recent introduction of the Motorola MPC555 automotive processor with its integrated memory and extensive onboard peripherals coupled with the latest GPS technology provides the opportunity to finally realize powerful yet inexpensive UAV avionics systems in very small footprints. Cloud Cap Technology has capitalized on these advances with the development of Piccolo a full-featured yet affordable end user programmable avionics development platform. The next step the PiccoloLT is a low cost derivative that trades hardware flexibility and expandability for further reductions in size and cost.  PiccoloLT will provide UAV developers with a highly integrated development platform that is small reliable and inexpensive enough to use on an expendable airplane. Phase I and II development will result in an extremely inexpensive avionics system which is software compatible with our more sophisticated Piccolo system.  The primary market niche for PiccoloLT is developers of expendable small unmanned aircraft; in particular the Navy to whom we hope to sell thousands of systems.      However PiccoloLT also has application in other markets:     1)  Research institutions that need a low cost yet flexible platform for developing research vehicles. Cloud Cap has been in contact with engineers from NASA Dryden Flight Research Center who have a need for low power avionics for small lightweight research UAVs. Their primary requirements are: low cost high-speed performance and rapid development tools.     2)  Universities with aeronautical and astronautical programs which need development tools and implementation platforms for graduate and senior design courses:  The Aeronautics and Astronautics department of the University of Washington has invested a large part of its capstone senior design course in unmanned aircraft development.  Their primary requirement is a low cost flexible avionics solution that can be used by students to develop unmanned aircraft technologies.   ","N012-0147","N01-147","01.2",

The meteorological sensing package onboard the Aerosonde provides pressure temperature humidity and wind. An upgraded sensor package is proposed which will also include turbulence measurement surface temperature icing and possibly visibility. The upgraded sensor package will be designed with consideration for mounting on different UAVs.

The trilateral filter is much less complex than current nonlinear PDE and variational solutions and yet produces at least comparable results in removing white noise while preserving image quality (edges and textures).  Furthermore while the nonlinear PDE and variational approaches are not effective for removing impulse noise the trilateral filter can even be used to remove mixed impulse and white noises.  In addition to optimizing the scale parameters of the trilateral filter and redesigning its spatial component to achieve even lower complexity our effort will focus on introducing the adaptivity feature to the new filters in this project.  In particular the new filters will adapt to image content with the goal of having the capability of processing both spatial and multispectral images.  The ultimate goal is to integrate the filter systems to UAV missions as a post-processing tool for Command and Control to clean up noisy optical infrared and radar images and video clips.    While the state-of-the-art methods and systems for removing noise from noisy image data without losing image quality are very costly the innovative system to be developed in this proposed project can do at least the same job with only a fraction of the computational and implementational costs.  In addition this new system will be more robust and readily integrated as a postprocessing tool in a wide variety of environments for cleaning up noisy optical infrared and radar images and video clips.  It has the potential of DUAL USE applications.  For government applications it could be used as a postprocessing tool for Command and Control of UAV missions; and for commercial applications it could be delivered as  a JAVA Applet to all internet users for image de-noising.

The major advantage of our solution approach to the UAV automatic landing task is generality: no airport surveying data is necessary. We rely on only one natural parameter the maximum false alarm rate unlike all previous methods that depend on a multitude of unstable thresholds. We propose to make all computational tasks the real-time in particular the detection of meaningful straight lines and to assess the precision of the measurements with respect to the resolution of the camera.

Power hungry chips often require heavy batteries and complex cooling units in environments where weight and space are at a premium.

Coherent Logix proposes to develop a complete system similar in function to that which is already in use translated for use in its massively paralleled HyperX integrated circuit technology to achieve far superior computation efficiency at a small fraction of the current required power.  Superior data fusion processing is the main anticipated benefit of this proposal. Commercial applications include medical imagery satellite surveillance and any other application where multiple waveband imagery is used.    The target market for the algorithms and software/hardware technologies being proposed is military systems requiring enhanced target acquisition tracking and discrimination performance.  The primary application is to improve the sensor platforms contributing to the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) systems.   The developed computation intensive technologies and capabilities will be applicable to the data fusion of multiple sensors in real time that these systems will require such as the next generation theater missile interceptors for the Navy Theater Wide (NTW) systems and the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV).

Coherent Logix will seek industrial military partners to help leverage the developed technologies into the next generation military systems.  Raytheon has provided a letter of support.    The digital signal processor software and hardware that will be developed is also applicable to the commercial markets where there is a predicted explosion of video signal volume over the next decade including such consumer products as digital broadcasting personal video recorders HDTV advanced medical imaging and video enabled PDAs.

The program proposes to develop a Smart Adaptive GPS Equipment (SAGE) System based on a modular and open software defined radio (SDR) platform built around Coherent Logix’s ultra-low power extremely-high performance reconfigurable (on-the-fly) HyperX processor.  This real-time reconfigurable low-power processor for signal processing provides SAGE the flexibility to rapidly develop and deploy a variety of advanced algorithms for GPS processing anti-jam multipath suppression receiver sensitivity improvements and power conservation.   BENEFIT:  The development of the SAGE will enable the DoD to provide every soldier with a power-efficient and cost-effective adaptive interference mitigation solution for robust military-code GPS receivers.  The adaptive reprogrammability make it suitable for applications in small UAVs small robotic vehicles and small guided munitions.  Exploiting Coherent Logix’s ultra low-power extremely high-performance HyperX processor will provide the Warfighter with a cognitive and adaptive GPS plus Interference Mitigation solution that will optimize GPS performance parameters such as position accuracy receiver sensitivity and power dissipation across a wide range of reception conditions.  Last the resulting technology facilitates an open system and promotes an industry friendly eco-system to facilitate innovation and value added product solutions that are critical to the upcoming Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) program supporting the Common GPS Module (CGM) concepts.","F093-154-1924","AF093-154","09.3",

Owing to the increasing complexity of conflict areas long standoff detection non-cooperative identification (NCTID) and targeting of both air and ground targets has increased in importance.  At the same time surveillance (UAVs) and strike platforms have become smaller while missions have increased.  Multi-function systems can address the diverse needs of reduced size/weight/power and increased functionality.  CTI proposes the continuation of a Phase I effort in combined FLIR-Coherent Laser Radar Cell Design to produce the first midwave infrared focalplanes with combined functionality of direct and coherent detection.  Midwave infrared (MWIR) sensor capability is of particular interest for weather & obscurant penetration enabling our forces to detect critical signatures in the conflict area under all conditions. The shape and vibrometry information provided by a coherent laser radar (coupled to a MWIR FLIR) can provide the critical data for rapid NCTID.  Significant leverage with a multi-million dollar DARPA MTO 3D Imaging Device program has already been shown in Phase I and is expected to continue during Phase II.  With the implementation of the proposed technology this sensor would provide the combined capabilities of high-resolution MWIR FLIR for passive infrared search & track (IRST) combined with active remote sensing of surface vibrations (ground & hard target).

Predictive methodology is deficient at these higher altitudes due to the complexity of the physics.   The proposed innovation serves to improve our ability to simulate higher altitude missile flows via extending newly developed hypersonic transitional models and hybrid continuum/DSMC methodology. In the altitude regime of 40-60 km laminar to turbulent transition occurs within this separation zone. Extensions of 3D PDE's for kL (laminar fluctuations) and for G (intermittency have been incorporated into the CRAFT CFD Navier-Stokes code in Phase I and will be extended to analyze plume/divert jet induced separated zones in Phase II. Above  60 km continuum breakdown occurs and we will improve upon the slip regime extensions and hybrid DSMC coupling (using the DAC97 code) initiated in Phase I. Research will focus on developing advanced coupling techniques at the breakdown surface thermochemical extensions and on developing new particulate integration techniques. The resultant hybrid code will provide high fidelity simulations at altitudes up to and beyond 100 km. CRAFT Tech has played a leading role in supporting systems and developmental studies related to missile plume/divert jet interactive flows at altitudes up to about 45km. This effort will provide for the extension of such activities to much higher altitudes permitting us to deal with a much broader array of problems. There is no high-fidelity CFD code that contains plume physics and addresses interactive issues and the Phase II development provides us with a very unique tool. Particular areas where we see major commercialization potential include: (1) support of Army interceptor technology programs; (2) support of MDA/MSIC Boost Phase Intercept studies for detection discrimination and plume to hardbody handover; (3) Liquid and Solid threat simulant booster design (for target usage) where we have been supporting a number of industrial groups; and (4) varied control jet interactions problems associated with small UAV's and with space vehicles.","A2-0877","A02-160","02.2",

Continuum Dynamics Inc. (CDI) proposes the development of a new dynamic model rotorcraft testing facility which may be scaled to accommodate a variety of wind tunnels and test venues.  This system will leverage previous corporate experience in dynamic model rotor testing and a first-principles time-accurate free wake analysis to design model supports and instrumentation that permits testing of the dynamic response of rotorcraft in a limited degree-of-freedom model experiment.

The goal of Phase I will be identification of a candidate test facility for fabrication and evaluation testing in Phase II. Accurate dynamic model testing of rotorcraft would bring substantial reductions in acquisition cost for a wide range of rotorcraft concepts through the reduction of time-consuming and expensive configuration changes at the prototype stage.  Understanding of the various design and operational limitations present in a rotorcraft configuration through dynamic testing would be particularly significant for the coming generation of Army VTOL UAVs.

Software tools and test techniques will also be developed during this program to support the design evaluation and implementation of the recovery system.  For Phase I initial development of the outer-loop control architecture will be performed and demonstrated through simulation and reduced degree-of-freedom wind tunnel testing.  This work will form the foundation for subsequent development implementation and evaluation on a generic fixed-wing UAV during the Phase II program.  ","N052-097-0279","N05-097","05.2",

Current airwake models in use however are limited to simulating only steady ship headings relative to a uniform flow field and do not include any dynamic ship motion responses to surface waves.  Continuum Dynamics Inc. (CDI) proposes the development of a new ship airwake/ship motion/aircraft motion software interface that will provide a range of code modules with scalable fidelity that can properly simulate the airwake environment around ships for aircraft flight simulation.  The resulting software can support ship designers dynamic interface (DI) test planners aircrew training and flight planning UAV operator interface design and sailor training exercises.  The Phase I/Phase II program will leverage: (1) previous corporate experience in unsteady flow analysis and software development; (2) an in-house first-principles time-accurate free wake analysis for rotorcraft flight dynamics; (3) a fast panel-based code for computing wakes and airloads from aircraft and lifting surfaces in arbitrary relative motion; and (4) recent research into supporting real-time simulation of the DI test environment. Accurate prediction of airwake effects on Naval aircraft would support enhanced safety of air operations from a range of surface vessels.  Use of the software by ship designers would provide a rapid assessment of the effects of ship modifications on aircraft launch and recovery effectiveness.  Components of the software can enhance the fidelity of real-time simulation of both manned and unmanned aircraft operations from Navy ships.","N022-1673","N02-127","02.2",

Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) is a new signal processing technique for advanced radar systems that allows for performance enhancements over conventional approaches. Current power weight and size constraints make the real-time implementation of full degrees-of-freedom STAP techniques on airborne/spaceborne platforms impractical. CPU Technology and University of Maryland Institute for Systems Research propose to investigate and demonstrate the advantages of applying 4th generation deeply coupled programmable SOC technology called the QX4 and other adaptive hardware elements to provide airborne platforms with the computing capacity required to perform real-time STAP techniques.  It provides 8.5 GFlops of 64-bit performance at only 8 watts of power.  The adaptive hardware will utilize floating gate technology to accelerate STAP radar processing.  We will code a STAP algorithm and execute the software on a single x86 microprocessor a QX4 array and a QX4 array with adaptive hardware to measure their relative performance.  Other metrics will include size weight power and accuracy.   We will also investigate adding STAP cost-effectively to existing radar processors. BENEFITS: Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) enhances the ability of radars to detect targets that might otherwise be obscured by clutter or by jamming using a two-dimensional filtering technique.  This capability enables a radar to see items under vegetation and provides much improved information in urban scenarios where clutter is extremely high and the targets are small.  Our goal is to make a high speed real-time STAP radar processor small enough and with minimal power so that STAP can be used by traditional airborne sensor platforms such as the E-2C as well as smaller aircraft such as fighters helicopters and UAVs.  It could potentially be used for the larger missiles as well.  Multidimensional processing such as found with STAP is used in many applications including mobile communications video processing medical imaging and radar processing.  Sensor fusion and autonomous operation could also potentially benefit from the compact performance throughput of QX4 and adaptive hardware techniques.","N064-005-0422","N06-T005","06  ",

This revolutionary technique can produce a fully solid state thin-film Li-ion cell in atmosphere with the ability to conformally apply the battery to nearly any surface. The equipment can produce the anode solid state electrolyte and cathode without pause and without changing hardware. Further a larger variety of chemical precursors can be utilized to create the active materials compared to sputtering and vapor deposition techniques allowing for independence from foreign sources of lithium and other rare earth materials. This layer-by-layer process can also retrofit thin-film Li-ion batteries to existing equipment (e.g. a UAV wing) or incorporate them into previously manufactured devices; no other process offers this feature. The overall objective of this proposal is to demonstrate that our novel plasma/laser manufacturing process can effectively create a solid state thin-film Li-ion cell which can meet capacity internal leakage shelf life and cycle life specifications for pairing with energy harvesting applications.","N11A-006-0383","N11A-T006","11.A",

BENEFIT:  This propulsion system is a significant advancement in the area of small to micro-UAVs.  It substantially reduces the weight of UAV propulsion system while remaining quiet and enabling much longer missions and higher battery payload for increased UAV effectiveness.

There are many reasons why UAVs are becoming the platform of choice over manned air assets for many missions. UAVs can be used to perform dangerous missions that would be too risky with a human pilot and can operate for long durations without concern about pilot fatigue. However overall mission length is affected by both pilot issues and the need for fuel the UAV can only carry a certain amount before needing to be refueled. The probe and drogue method has been used successfully to refuel both manned and unmanned aerial vehicles in flight effectively extending the maximum mission length for these platforms. Typically refueling of UAVs is done with a human pilot teleoperating the aircraft. However the long-term goal for UAVs (and the focus of much current research) is to make them operate autonomously. Therefore there is a need for a system that allows a UAV to autonomously rendezvous with a refueling tanker and then correctly insert the refueling probe into the drogue.

This project will develop real-time multithreaded algorithms that will process sensor inputs manage priorities plan aircraft trajectories and generated autopilot inputs.  The project will also involve an extensive modeling and simulation effort in order to perform tests and demonstrations of the algorithms developed.  The resulting simulation capability may also be useful for testing alternative algorithms and for developing and refining system requirements and specifications.  UAVs with autonomous capabilities are essentially flying robots.  As robots they need to gather information (sensory input) about the environment around them and make decisions about what they should be doing (controlling actuators or devices).  Sensors and devices must be dealt with concurrently otherwise devices can get starved and sensors ignored.  The software design is patterned after the latest generation robotic software.  To support testing and validation a simulation testbed based on the USAF EAAGLES toolkit will be used. This will allow testing in a high-density environment.  EAAGLES was built to support distributed simulation so that many EAAGLES-based applications can be executed simultaneously thereby generating many players without compromising performance.","N081-079-1000","N08-079","08.1",

However for the combat aerial video (usually low resolution video) all the static indexes used for object classification and recognition are almost impossible to obtain. To address this challenge researchers are particularly interested in developing new techniques to determine the type functionality purpose or intent of static and moving objects through analysis of dynamic information in persistent surveillance video. The objects of interest include buildings functional areas vehicles and human beings.   In this proposal DCM Research Resources LLC and its collaborator propose to develop an automatic innovative 3D and dynamic semantic scene analysis based approach that exploits surveillance video data mainly captured from UAV platforms to classify buildings vehicles and people automatically. In our proposed automatic object detection and classification system in addition to 3D static object’s visual features (e.g. building’s shape line orientation color and texture) and the 3D static structures of the urban environment we will also explore dynamic video features which include vehicle/human motion patterns over time. All these static and dynamic features will be used to construct spatial-temporal feature vectors and the new generated vectors will then be sent to a probabilistic Dynamic Influence Diagram (DID) reasoning model for real-time and automatic building/vehicle classification. Besides the novel algorithms on building and vehicle classification we also propose a Decentralized Dynamic Markov Game Model (DDMGM) for human activity and intent inference. In addition we propose to develop novel 3D algorithms on automatic building detection 3D terrain modeling and visualization to support accurate object category and classification.

The focus of the program is to develop a prototype situation awareness system (MMCAS) for installation on UAVs that integrates the situation awareness information provided by TCAS with detection and tracking information on non-cooperative intruders to avoid a mid-air collision.  Non-cooperative intruders are detected and tracked by a relatively low cost light weight optical Detect and Avoid (DAA) system that has been developed and matured under other research programs.  The TCAS is already approved for installation on Global Hawk and demonstrations of DAA on surrogate UAV aircraft have verified that the DAA technology meets Global Hawk and Predator requirements.  This program upgrades the existing UAV collision avoidance capability which now only supports cooperative aircraft operations to include all aircraft in close proximity.  The innovative work to be accomplished on the program is to design the fusion software and user interface needed to implement the integration of the two systems.  The fusion software can reside in either the existing onboard TCAS interface computer or on a separate microprocessor added for this purpose depending on the specific UAV system requirements","F2-2249","AF04-225","04.1",

This concept would allow the P-3 aircraft and crew to remain at a safe altitude and range while successfully gathering sensor information and fulfilling the mission. The creation of this UAV with its interchangeable payloads would make it possible for it to be used on all P-3 aircraft due to the standardized bomb racks. Currently available sensors can fulfill these requirements but there is currently no vehicle available that can be launched from either Wing or Bomb Bay.  In Phase I of this SBIR DTI and their Team will develop a design approach that will meet all requirements for a Wing and Bomb Bay Launched (WBBL) UAV.

The ability to take a real-time UAV video feed and correlate the Meta data with map data does not currently exist in UAV Ground Control Stations (GCS).  However this capability would considerably increase the operators’ situational awareness as well as intelligence analysis capabilities.  The ideal approach is to use open architecture software engineering independent of existing hardware.  This approach allows the Air Force to solve this challenge through software and allow the ability to pull or push data from existing hardware independent of platform or hardware configuration.  This then gives the Air Force a “services” based solution that allows the system more modularity in collection methods and the assets used to collect the data.  DTI will leverage our extensive experience in open architecture control stations and sensors to provide a variety of possible solutions.   A variety of missions or threats require a common architecture with multiple solutions that can be implemented by applying open architectures and standards.  DTI is writing this proposal in a format that will allow the Air Force to select single or multiple solutions.  DTI has working relationships with all companies listed herein and can aggressively begin implementing the proposed solutions.     BENEFIT:  DTI will bring together Open Architecture Software Design human factors expertise sensor data processing data fusion and network engineering that would provide an ideal solution for enhancing video overlays.  DTI’s Open Unmanned Mission Interface (OpenUMI) software provides an advanced interoperability on a common operator interface independent of operating systems using the latest STANAG 4586 and JAUS V3.3 standards.  OpenUMI also provides cross platform support and is tested in the Windows and Linux environments. This allows the software to run on a variety of hardware and is compatible with fielded software such as Falcon View.  OpenUMI is built on the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Unmanned Systems Research and Development Laboratory (USRDL) MURC open source project and contains customer specific configuration files and installers.

The noise and performance results will be compared with the best (chosen a priori) commercially available two-bladed propeller.  The quiet highly efficient propeller will be designed to maintain optimum propulsive efficiency while still meeting the low noise objectives.  This Phase I program uses a combined theoretical-experimental approach with an emphasis on producing propeller designs that meet noise and performance goals with less emphasis on mass production design and manufacturing.  Design variables such as propeller diameter blade number blade shape etc. will be systematically analyzed to achieve program objectives.  A novel hub/blade design will facilitate parametric testing so that theory can be validated early and often.  Manufacturing techniques are developed to produce five propellers of the same design for testing by the Navy at the end of Phase I.  In the later stages of the program (Phases II and III) new designs will be proposed that further reduce noise levels while maintaining good performance.  Mass production methods will be employed to produce propellers that are durable and consistently perform as designed. The realization of a very quiet highly efficient safe cost-effective propeller for small UAVs will be welcomed by DoD other government agencies and the model airplane hobbyist.  There are many military needs and requirements for this technology but there may be even more demand for this technology for civilian applications.  Having a quiet propeller (together with a quiet engine) will help make model airplane flying less of an annoyance to the urban communities that normally surround practice airfields.  If the cost performance and safety of the resulting propeller is comparable to the two bladed rotor a very large market will develop.    Because of the increased interest on security and surveillance there is little doubt of the need of this technology.  The Navy has already indicated a potential need for several thousand quiet propellers for use in their small UAV program.  A market study of these needs for government and civilian uses will be conducted in Phase III of this program.  Commercialization for the government and civilian markets will be approached in several ways.  All phases of DGI's small UAV propeller program will be open to the government the small propeller manufacturing industry and the hobbyist.  We will solicit ideas from the users and manufacturers through our local contacts.  When we have documented significant noise reductions with good performance we will report these results in the open literature.  In Phase III of the program when the final propeller designs are tested by the Navy we will encourage flight demonstrations with the military and civilian flying clubs to demonstrate the operational potential of this low noise propeller.  In Phase III DGI will also use the chosen manufacturing partner or subcontractor's marketing network to commercialize the low noise highly efficient propeller.  Coincident with these efforts DGI will make special presentations to interested members of government agencies and commercial vendors.","N021-1211","N02-096","02.1",

One aspect of the design of these systems that tends to be both difficult and poorly supported with available computer design technology today is the difficult step of determining placement locations for the components within a product housing or container (the space available for component placement). In Phase I we developed technology to hierarchically cluster sets of components into subsystems each of which can be laid out first independently and then refined as they are integrated into a complete system placement.  The next challenge to clustering is to create smart clusters to enable the system’s ability to satisfy design constraints during layout of large and complex interactive systems.

Technology developments in areas such as vehicle morphing and energy harvesting will enable greater mission capabilities in terms of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) – including “close-in ISR” and “personal ISR” as well as lethality capabilities and signals intelligence (SIGINT).  The current Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) MAV vision includes plans to develop a “bird-like” MAV by the year 2015 that is capable of “perch and stare” missions. When the MAV arrives at a mission station it will “perch” much like an actual bird lands and perches. A critical components for perching is the landing gear mechanism necessary to accomplish perching on a variety of surfaces and environments. Limited ground mobility is desirable for purposes such as energy harvesting (EH) sensor alignment and assisted takeoff.  The proposed Phase I research will develop multiple engineering design concept variants that utilize innovative bio-inspired principals from bird anatomy innovative use of advanced actuator technology as well as innovative robotics concepts to develop landing gear that can enable perching and limited ground mobility. Whenever possible DII will utilize modular design concepts that enable broad mission capabilities.  BENEFIT:  Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) represent the most dynamic growth sector in the aerospace industry today. The total market size is expected to be between $40 billion and $60 billion by the year 2018. The proposed research if successful could provide significant breakthroughs and advantages for MAV operational capabilities. A successful outcome of this Phase I effort will result in technology that can be utilized by the DoD and other government agencies as well as the commercial sector. Advanced landing gear technology that supports UAVs/MAVs is useful to the Air Force the Army and the Navy for various mission needs.  These types of UAVs/MAVs can also be used by other agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security the Department of the Interior and others.

In the proposed effort DES will design fabricate test and delivery a cryogenically cooled multiple diode laser stack system.  Output powers of the laser system of 6 kW are anticipated with a scaling option at the 12 kW level.  At the end of proposed effort the system will be delivered to AFRL/RDLS for testing and evaluation.   The proposed effort will leverage past and present DES programs on high power solid-state laser and cryogenic laser systems.  BENEFIT:  There are several key technologies that will be developed during the proposed multiple phase program which possess significant commercialization opportunities.  These technologies are: • Cryogenic Solid-State Lasers  • Narrow Linewidth Diode Laser Bars  • Widely Tunable Diode Laser Devices (smaller market not discussed below)  DES is developing multiple products based on the key technologies and upon completion of these devices will seek VC funding to bring these devices to market.  Incubic is one venture fund that DES has experience with and would contact about possible product funding.  Each of these technologies commercialization potential will be discussed below. Cryogenic Solid-State Lasers: The developed diode pump technology can be applied to virtually any solid-state material which results in a variety of emission wavelengths.  For instance high power devices can be demonstrated in Yb (~1030 nm) Nd (~1060 nm) Er (~1600 nm and 2940 nm) Tm (~2100 nm) and Ho (~2000 nm).  These efficient compact high power laser devices with excellent beam quality are in great demand as can be seen by the variety of industrial academic and military based applications. • Asset protection – A high average power eye-safe laser would allow for the protection of US assets against rockets artillery and mortars with a significantly reduced risk of collateral eye damage.  The compact and self-contained design of a 100 kW device would allow for a variety of tactical platforms to be used such as UAV and ground based vehicles.   • LIDAR/LADAR – High average power LIDAR/LADAR systems can be made using Er Tm and Ho as possible hosts.  In the case of the relatively long excited state lifetime of Er:YAG (10 ms) laser systems with repetition rates of 100 Hz can be made.  This enables a multi joule per pulse laser system with a moderate power master oscillator.  This high energy coupled with near diffraction limited beam quality is ideal for high resolution LIDAR/LADAR at a distance.  This device would have industrial academic and military based customers • Pump Lasers – Frequency doubling of a cryogenic Yb:YAG would allow for efficiency high energy pumping of Ti:Sapphire.  The variable pulse repetition frequency and pulse length make this type of laser source ideal for pump an fs Ti:Sapphire amplifier.  In addition high power OPOs can be made with these efficient pump sources • Spectrally diverse lasers - The cryogenic solid-state laser is an ideal pump source for high energy Raman lasers.  These lasers can be operated continuous wave or pulsed.  The variety of Raman active materials would enable nearly complete spectral coverage from the visible to the mid-wave infrared. DES is developing a 30 W cryogenic Yb:YAG laser which can be operated continuous wave and pulsed.  Upon completion of this device DES will seek out VC funding to produce the product targeting the aforementioned markets.  Incubic is one venture fund that DES would contact about possible product funding. Narrow Linewidth Diode Laser Bars The development proposed in this multi phase effort can also be applied to narrow linewidth diode laser bars and stacks.  Narrow linewidth diode laser bars has clear commercialization potential for optical pump sources for solid-state lasers such as Er:YAG and Yb:YAG (970 nm line).  In addition Alkali metal lasers may also require narrow linewidth pump lasers for efficient operation.  DES has extensive experience in the production of optical singlet delta oxygen (SDO) using linewidth narrowed diode laser bars.  This SDO technology kills bacteria and viruses and oxidizes VOCs and other chemical agents by using only air (oxygen) and light (from diodes).  Therefore it represents a unique capability for sterilization decontamination pollution mitigation and air quality improvement applications in hospitals homes commercial buildings manufacturing and power generation plants and government installations and vehicles.  Its effectiveness in killing cells is steeped in 20 years of research associated with Photodynamic Therapy where SDO is used to kill tumorous tissue in a light activated cancer treatment.  Its usefulness in oxidizing chemicals to safe products is well established.  What has been lacking is an effective way to make SDO in the air in large quantities. DES has overcome this last obstacle to commercialization. ","F2-4623","AF073-003","07.3",

The Phase II program completes the design of the IBIS including design of the IMM cell in concert with the cell supplier bypass diode integration covershield material wiring and stowage.  Coupons will be assembled and tested to characterize and compare covershield material performance in multiple radiation environments.  Three IBIS module test articles will be constructed utilizing streamlined manufacturing methods and an automated consistent interconnecting method.  The modules will undergo testing in relevant space environments including thermal cycling and thermal vacuum with pre- and post- LAPSS characterization.  Completion of the Phase II effort will see the IBIS technology ready for insertion into military commercial or experimental flight applications.  Particular emphasis will be placed on inserting the IBIS in a flight experiment quickly possibly as part of the MATRS experiment which already plans to fly DRT hardware.    BENEFIT:  An IBIS array that implements high-efficiency thin-film solar cells offers several advantages over traditional triple junction rigid substrate arrays.  The flexible nature of the IBIS and its reduced thickness allow it to be stowed in a low volume.  This feature along with the higher mass-specific power of the IBIS allows more power to be launched with a satellite than has ever been possible previously.  Further the continuous covershield allows the use of higher voltages which can in turn reduce gauge and weight of the wire harness.  The laminated approach to the manufacture of the IBIS lends itself to lower manufacturing costs.  This and the automation that is possible with novel interconnect approaches both reduce cost and improve reliability.  Overall the cost of the IBIS is likely to be lower than that of a traditional array.    These features make the IBIS highly desirable for high-power missions that would not have previously considered a planar solar array.  Such missions include DARPA FAST Boeing HPSA and MDA STSS.  Additional applications include those with a high premium on mass such as UAVs or high-altitude airships.","F2-5266","AF083-201","08.3",

The challenge is two-fold. First predicting the trajectories of dynamic obstacles (i.e. cars humans aircraft) is very noisy. As a result to achieve robust execution perception modules need to provide a richer representation of predictions while planning modules need to account for the uncertainty in the predictions. Second planning with dynamic obstacles is computationally complex because it requires adding time as an additional dimension while paths in dynamic environments need to be constantly re-computed. In Phase I we have developed a novel path planner that addresses these challenges. It includes a novel representation of dynamic obstacles that can be used to generate safe paths efficiently and is general enough for use with different sensor suites. The planner also uses a novel data structure - time-bounded lattice. The lattice can be used efficiently with our previously developed re-planning algorithms suitable for constant re-planning. In Phase II we propose to extend the planner to support planning for UAVs transition it into the DPI real-time control software and demonstrate its performance on real test flights of DPI helicopters.","D2-0854","SB082-030","08.2",

DropMaster Inc. is proposing a solution that is cheaper simpler and more effective than the current method of air delivery.  The proposed system will also be more effective in terms of range accuracy visual signature and payload.  This capability will be able to supply either mobile or stationary units operating behind enemy lines or in friendly territory with POL ammunition weapons commo water food and medical material.  The delivery aircraft will be able to deliver the system without having to slow down or land therefore reducing airdrop signature and greatly improving survivability for both the aircrew and the ground force.  The initial effort will be to field an inexpensive and disposable auto-rotating carton which can be airdropped from a wide range of civil and military platforms including rotary-wing fixed-wing or unmanned aircraft.  This effort will provide a container for the airdrop of supplies or equipment without a requirement for a reusable/recoverable parachute. The DropMaster Inc. proposed solution known as the CopterBox has the potential to be suitable for other agencies as well as non-governmental organizations such as:  US Forest Service Law Enforcement Search and Rescue Red Cross and Humanitarian Relief.  The CopterBox would be especially useful in situations in which the landing of a helicopter or aircraft would not be possible.  If supply operations would compromise operations or endanger the lives of ground personnel or aircrew then the CopterBox should be used.  Areas where landing zones are not available airdrops where penetration of tree cover is required other remote areas logistical operations Civil Military/Humanitarian supply disaster relief search and rescue forest fire team support psychological warfare leaflet delivery or sensor package delivery are all potential uses for the CopterBox EADS system","A022-1618","A02-197","02.2",

(ECI) and Dr. Perry Alexander of the University of Kansas presents a unique and commercially viable solution to the problem specifying and creating self-correcting systems of digital hardware and software. Our Capturing Error and Repair Strategies at a System Level (SystemCritics) program will apply: Rosetta the SLDL; SyscapeT the block diagram editor; and VectorGenT the test vector generator to provide the ability to enter system information error conditions and repair strategy; generate tests to detect when error conditions occur; and act to correct those error conditions. Specifically we propose to use Rosetta the Systems Level Design Language (SLDL) to describe the system state in its full functionality error conditions and repair strategies; Syscape the systems level block diagram editor to enter this information graphically; VectorGen our test vector generator to create tests to detect if a part of the system is not functioning properly and to identify what that part is; and the Rosetta Execution Engine (REE) to take the specifications in Rosetta and produce an execution of the system specifications and the error strategies. The result of this solution will provide a complete mechanism for defining critics that describe self-correcting systems and implementing them. This technology could enhance any software system that requires frequent updates or varied specializations. Initial focus will be on military and NASA high-integrity applications where a practical self-correcting system definition and implementation system is required.    Potential Applications of SystemCritics are instances where high-integrity software is needed but particularly in avionics software (especially UAVs) space probes nuclear plants and other high-integrity applications in medical systems automotive applications and commercial aircrafts.

The xSTREAM transceiver consists of a receiver for command and control and a transmitter for streaming of image telemetry and other sensor data.    The xSTREAM architecture is designed to be compatible within the architecture of the Joint Tactical Radio Systems (JTRS).

Extensions to these WNW Signals in Space (SiS) framing and Medium Access Control (MAC) are provided to enable adaptive operation in a variable data rate and variable link conditions. Also approaches to matching the variable data rate with variable rate image compression header compression and storage/playback will be investigated.

In addition to exploiting Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) implementation methods ECC's approach also exploits link power control.    The current BEAM implementation in an ARC-210 radio uses multiple devices to enable the maximum flexibility. ECC asserts that most of the transceiver can be implemented in a custom Hi-BEAM ASIC. This level of integration has dramatic size and power consumption reductions. It is expected that Hi-BEAM ASIC will consume less than 2W of DC power. Thus with the Hi-BEAM ASIC the overall Hi-BEAM transceiver can be implemented in a small form factor (less than 50 in2) allowing for flexibility in mounting and integration with the small UA. ECC estimates the Hi-BEAM transceiver will use less than 25 watts of  DC power while transmitting at 10 watts.

Such an analysis system can be integrated into a small autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and used for the detection and identification of unexploded ordnance in bodies of water. Phase I involved the design and fabrication of a prototype pre-concentration sampling instrument based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME). The design that was developed utilizes miniaturized components to achieve a compact rugged sampling system that can be easily integrated into AUVs. In Phase II we will refine this design to a more compact tightly integrated preconcentrator and develop an interface with an ion mobility spectrometer with capability for automated remote operation.

This is largely due to the fact that the operational envelopes of these vehicles are based solely on at-sea flight testing.  In addition to the complexities involved with at-sea flight testing the unsteady nature of ship-airwakes and the use of automated UAV control software necessitates that these tests be extremely conservative in nature.  Instead of flight testing modeling and simulation could be used to predict UAV operation under these conditions.  Unfortunately the computational requirements for a fully-coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solution render such an approach impractical.  To overcome this limitation requires the creation of simulators that model the full level of detail required but have drastically reduced run times.  To overcome these obstacles requires a two-pronged approach: algorithmic improvements and implementation improvements.  In this project we address both of these needs.  We will create a solver by coupling the combined computational aeroacoustic (CAA) method with more traditional CFD algorithms and implement it on commodity graphics cards to reduce computation times by orders of magnitude.  The result will be a tool for the rapid and accurate simulations analysis of UAVs in near-ship environments.","N074-004-0297","N07-T004","07  ",

They must be able to generate and follow a notional path to an assigned spot based on the director's instructions.  But relying on the director's signals alone is not enough.  They must be constantly aware of their surroundings as conditions change rapidly and unexpectedly.  This is a proposal to develop innovative cognitive perception and intelligent vehicle control techniques for autonomous flight-deck navigation.  Our core innovations are 1) a human gesture recognition algorithm for human hand signal input 2) a hidden-Markov-model-based command interpretation module 3) a rough path-planning method using dynamic mapping and 4) a learning method for fine motion control.  We will develop the algorithms and supporting software in object-oriented toolkit form.  This will support easy modification and reuse.  From this work Energid Technologies plans to develop and sell software toolkits in the areas of collision avoidance path-planning and gesture recognition.  Though the source code will be provided to the DoD other customers will purchase the toolkit as software libraries and header files.  This toolkit will have wide application.  One prominent example is the airline industry.  The gesture recognition algorithms can be used as a redundancy check for pilots following director's commands.  Other applications include home factory and farm environments.  Energid has special interest in agricultural applications in particular automated harvesting.  We believe the path planning and collision avoidance algorithms developed here can be applied to the guidance of autonomous harvesting vehicles.","N033-0133","N03-T003","03  ",

The proposed propulsion system is based on a new engine concept that provides higher specific impulse than rockets or tubojets.  It is more efficient than conventional engines because of its constant-volume nonsteady operating cycle and has no moving parts in the power productin section.  In PDEs a detonation wave is initiated in a mixture of aspirated air and fuel and propagates axially in the detonation chamber.  Thurst is generated when the wave impinges on the thrust wall.  The use of multiple chambers allows thrust vectoring and enhances engine reliability and efficiency.  PDEs are more efficient than tubojets at small scale require no exotic materials and are less expensive to build.  Their structural efficiency is greater than that of IC engines and they can operate at higher speeds.  They avoid the power density limitations of electric power generation and the low specific impulse of solid propellants and can incorporate thrust vectoring and thrust level control which enhances maneuverability.

This device is comprised of a resonant gyroscope technology housed in an environmental resistant package (ERP). The gyroscope alone meets all of the necessary technical specification for antenna pointing and navigation performance except for the bias drift stability which is strongly temperature dependent. The ERP technology allows for the temperature of this gyroscope to be held at a constant temperature by holding it on an isolation platform and housing them in a vacuum environment. During operation the gyroscope temperature will be held at 95 degrees Celsius using <50 mW oven control over a -55 to 85 degree outside temperature range. Holding the gyroscope to a temperature stability of 0.041 degrees Celsius to 3 sigma should enable the above mentioned application. The key technical challenge in this project will be to develop proportional integral derivative (PID) control algorithms and other techniques for achieving this high level of temperature stability across a wide temperature range.  BENEFIT:  The benefits/potential commercial applications of this project will be to bring a new low size weight and power (SWAP) gyroscope technology to market for tactical and navigation grade applications. This device will be nearly 100 times smaller and lower power and will cost as much as 10 times less then conventional technologies such as hemispherical resonant gyroscopes (HRG). Its main application will be in closed loop antenna pointing applications for broadband battlefield communications and its extremely small size will allow for placement of the sensor at the phase center of these antennas enabling highly precise attitude accuracy. Its very low cost will enable the use of these antennas in a broader range of aircraft and ground vehicles. This gyroscope technology will also be applicable in existing and emerging markets including missile and satellite attitude control attitude control of vehicles and hulls on tanks Jeeps and Humvees and miniaturized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Furthermore the environmental resistant package (ERP) one of the enabling pieces of this technology can be applied for temperature control and shock protection of other types of sensors including low power oven controlled oscillators for high precision clock references and highly shock resistant accelerometers and gyroscopes.","F093-140-1421","AF093-140","09.3",

This approach avoids the limitations imposed by conventional spatial light modulators in two-dimensional optical pattern recognition and correlation systems.  This optical processing system is based on the Essex patented ImSyn (trademark) processor which combines optical and digital integration to achieve high dynamic range.  The proposed processor is based on a processing method that uses both phase and amplitude information to produce true complex valued transforms.  Because the processor operates on complex data improvements in pattern recognition performance may be achieved over traditional optical methods which use either amplitude-only or phase-only processing without a penalty in size power weight or cost.  The complete hybrid system can be manufactured in a small low power and lightweight package for use in automatic targeting of small munitions.  The Phase I effort used the ImSyn breadboard to demonstrate image correlations using M48 tank images and complex valued filters provided by WL/Eglin AFB and the detailed design for a Phase II system.  This Phase II effort will build and deliver an optical correlation processor suitable for installation onboard an unmanned air vehicle (UAV).

It seeks for approaches and methods that may be attractive not only to satellites and interceptors but also to UAV/UCAV platforms. We are proposing novel algorithmic frameworks for moving platforms (UAV types) relying on a standalone compact vision system built from state of the art commercial-off-the shelf (COTS) and military-off-the shelf (MOTS) components. We are proposing an efficient adaptive algorithmic framework for process real-time applications making an optimal use of the available computing power reaching some specific task related goals.

In our algorithmic framework a spatial multi-grid computing is placed within a temporal multi-rate structure and at each spatial grid point the computation is based on an adaptive multi-scale approach. The algorithms assume a reconfigurable analogic hardware architecture consisting of a high resolution optical sensor a low resolution cellular sensor-processor and a digital signal processor.

However the material is also known to act as an electronic conductor. This electronic conductivity prevents its use as a solid-state electrolyte in next generation lithium batteries.

The proposed system provides a comprehensive solution for facilitating and managing cooperative behaviors amongst heterogeneous systems with a focus on enhanced behavior through learning.  Our  solution addresses multiple groups and echelons of agents with mixed levels of autonomy on mixed--initiative mission sets. The construct proposed is robust scalable and portable. To demonstrate the implementation of the proposed architecture and paradigm we will leverage our existing software ingredients for Intelligent--Autonomous Mobile Systems (I--AMS) that can be quickly integrated into various platform types. These decentralized individual intelligent systems are then simulated together to evaluate their overall cooperative behaviors with respect to the applied learning methodologies.  We treat cooperative behaviors merely as an extension of the decision making process taking into consideration the probable decisions that neighboring agents would make allowing for cooperation with minimal communication requirements; similar to how humans and other higher cognitive forms of life cooperate.  BENEFIT:  There are many military and civilian applications of the proposed cooperative behavior control system to automatically readjust mission objectives and tasks based on perceived changes in environments and mission requirements for cooperative unmanned systems. Such applications range from search and rescue inspection and surveillance reconnaissance anti-terror surveillance fire monitoring pipeline inspection traffic monitoring disaster management and response to name a few.","F121-002-2138","AF121-002","12.1",

Such antennas need to reach as low as VHF frequencies and must be positioned to look to the side of the aircraft. To satisfy this requirement tapered slot antennas (TSAs) looking off the wingtip have been proposed. However this antenna receives only a single horizontal polarization. No solution currently exists for either a dual polarized antenna or a vertically polarized antenna looking off the wingtip of an inflatable wing. To address this requirement for a dual polarity antenna we will investigate a dual-polarized TSA that can be mounted onto a UAV with an inflatable wing. A vertical TSA will be added to the horizontal TSA in its plane of symmetry so the two antennas do not interact with each other. We also consider the problem of a single vertically polarized antenna that is flush-mounted to an inflatable wing. To achieve this we propose a Conical Slot Antenna (CSA) printed onto the wing. During Phase I we will design build and test a dual-polarized TSA and a vertically polarized CSA. ","F041-006-1547","AF04-006","04.1",

Such antennas can aid a number of missions in a cost-effective manner including Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Foliage Penetration (FOPEN) Ground Moving Target Indicators (GMTI) and Counter-Camouflage Concealment and Deception (CC&D). UAVs have been shown to be a cost-effective method of carrying out these missions but without the right antennas these missions may fall short of their goals. The antennas required for these missions must be effective over a broad bandwidth and they can induce only minimal drag on the surface of the aircraft. The frequencies of interest extend as low as 25 MHz. It is at the low end of the band where size constraints are most challenging. Obtaining a good antenna pattern is a challenge unless the antenna is the same size as a wavelength. Impedance matching over a broad bandwidth is also a challenge because electrically small antennas normally have a matching circuit that provides a good match only within a very narrow band. Another challenge lies in steering the beam electronically. To address these challenges we propose developing a crossed linear dipole array along the bottom of the fuselage and wing that is flush with the aircraft surface. We will explore antennas that reach as low as 25 MHz with a decade of bandwidth. Designs that introduce minimal drag will be considered. We will calculate the antenna pattern and we will calculate impedance match and radiation efficiency. We will also consider how to design systems with two polarizations.

Such antennas can aid a number of missions including Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) Foliage Penetration(FOPEN) and High-Frequency(HF) Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR).  Such antennas are also critical components of broadband Remote Target Identification(RTID) systems.  For these systems antennas are required with a compact form factor broad bandwidth high gain low crosspol levels and low sidelobe level (SLL).  No antenna currently available  satisfies all these criterion. One antenna however has many of the required characteristics.  Impulse Radiating Antennas (IRAs) satisfy the bandwidth and form factor requirements but they require modifications to comply with crosspol and sidelobe level (SLL) requirements.  These antennas were originally designed for operation with time domain impulses where crosspol and SLL requirements are less critical.  When they are adapted to a broadband continuous wave (CW) mission they require modifications. The purpose of the Phase II effort is twofold.  First we will design and build an Enhanced IRA which incorporates a variety of improvements to the standard IRA that are important to CW operation.  These improvements include high-end bandwidth polarization purity mechanical strength and side-lobe level (SLL).  After improvements to the antenna have been demonstrated the Enhanced IRA will be incorporated into an operational broadband CW radar system the AFRL radar van.

The focus of this effort is the study and design of antenna systems and associated signal processing for future weapon systems and munitions.  The proposed SAR sensor can be configured to process in SAR and Moving Target Indication (MTI) modes which enables the same sensor to be used for acquiring and tracking stationary and moving mobile/re-locatable targets.  Overall the benefits of a SAR seeker for a PGM application are clear but the implementation on the munition size platform to date has been the challenge.  The desire is for a small size (6" platform) increased resolution and low cost.  The requirement exists for a weapon seeker to have all weather precise targeting and engagement capability.  Some current and future weapon systems will loiter in the battlefield or target area in search of specific targets and targets of opportunity.  The technology proposed will significantly reduce the cost of current SOA systems.  the proposed approach will provide commercial application to GPWS in commercial air safety.","F031-1760","AF03-143","03.1",

Because space is limited aboard the objective airframes this antenna engineering design concept transforms the structural members of the airframe into radiating surfaces.  Through the proposed Phase I program FIRST RF will apply the hardware and methods of this concept to develop an antenna targeted for AFRL’s objective vehicle. This antenna is integrated directly into a composite layup that forms a load-bearing aerodynamic surface.  The proposed antenna meets AFRL-MN’s challenging bandwidth specifications desired gain coverage and polarization diversity while remaining completely within the existing vehicle Outer Mold Line (OML).  This antenna is a departure from the standard design approach for airborne conformal antennas in that it makes full use of the entire airframe to radiate.  Contrast this novel approach to the standard wraparound antenna or conformal drop-in approach that protrudes into the vehicle fuselage.  Through a symbiotic relationship between composites materials and RF engineering this design concept transforms the vehicle structure itself into an antenna.","F071-147-2547","AF071-147","07.1",

FIRST RF has developed a breakthrough method of transforming the airframe of the vehicle itself into an antenna namely the wings.  The Phase I program was successful in developing a very novel antenna technology – the LEADeR antenna - whereby the entire wing serves as part of the antenna.  Because the antenna effective aperture is so much bigger than traditional highly-tuned resonant approaches the antenna input impedance is much more amenable to broadband matching techniques.  The direct application of this antenna technology includes two specific airborne platforms with a requirement to transmit high power RF signals over a broad frequency range – VHF through upper UHF.

Generally conformal antennas are either narrow band or inefficient. Low frequency antennas are usually large and not conformal. The intense research in metamaterials for antenna applications over the past decade has been focused on reducing the size and footprint of antennas allowing for conformal installation of antennas that otherwise would remain as drag inducers on aircraft.  But if the performance benefits of these materials are to be realized they need to become lighter and more affordable. Otherwise they are too heavy and too expensive to fly aboard UAVs.  During Phase I of this program FIRST RF validated the performance of a lower cost and lighter weight alternative metamaterial for use in the design of a communications antenna and a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) antenna. We have measured data supporting our fundamental claim that there are manufacturable and fieldable conventional metamaterials.  The Phase II program that we propose here will be focused on putting the Phase I research into action by building application specific hardware for both a communications antenna and for an ISR (Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance) antenna.  BENEFIT:  The benefits of this technology start with the affect the technology has on conformal antenna operating near a ground plane.  Most low frequency and/or broadband antennas are not able to operate conformally because of the band limited nature of operation in proximity to a ground plane.  Metamaterial research for antenna applications has been very focused on allowing conformal antennas to operate at low frequencies and over broad bandwidths.  But physical embodiments of many metamaterials are very expensive and very heavy.  The proposed technology is a low cost and lightweight alternative to these materials benefitting conformal antenna and airframe designers as well as general users of metamaterials for conformal applications.","F2-6249","AF103-172","10.3",

There are four key components of this approach which will be analyzed. High pole count high energy permanent magnet brushless technology will be used to provide a single integrated device for the purpose of starting small internal combustion engines in the 30 lbs thrust class and power generation.  Advances in power electronic technologies allows for the miniaturization of the conversion device to provide power for driving the starter and regulating the generator voltage.    Direct to shaft mounting eliminates the need for any intermediate mechanical devices (e.g. gears belts couplings and clutches).  Minimizing the size of the starter motor will be accomplished by reducing peak torque requirements of the internal combustion engine.  We will analyze the effect of compression release and system inertia.

The key challenge is to physically realize these novel variable geometry adaptive structures for meso-scale vehicles with severe limitations on space weight and power.

Through aerodynamics analysis and experimental testing we propose to first identify the most effective means to realize performance gains using variable geometry and deployable turbulators to reduce low Re airfoil drag over broad operating regimes.

These engines are single-shaft turbojets and their use in propulsion systems for future advanced munitions such as the Air Force’s Low Cost Miniature Cruise Missile (LCMCM) limit the munition’s operational capability.  Because of their poor fuel consumption small (<300 lbs thrust SLS) turbojet propulsion systems offer short range and low loiter times.  Florida Turbine Technologies Inc. (FTT) recently developed and demonstrated a unique twin-spool micro turbofan (37 lbf) with half the fuel consumption relative to today’s military turbojet baseline.  FTT will leverage this technology by scaling the engine core components and developing a core demonstrator for an efficient high performance 250 lbf turbofan engine.  While typically new engine centerline development is quite costly FTT’s scaling approach provides a means to significantly reduce the cost of development for new engines.  This program will advance the state-of-the-art in long-range high efficiency small engine propulsion and provide data to support the viability of scaling for engine design.  The resulting technology can be directly applied to the development of a 250 lbf turbofan.    BENEFIT:  Forecasters project that small turbine engines will replace legacy propulsion systems for small munitions and UAVs at significantly rapid rates in the next ten years.  Turbine engines offer advantages in speed and altitude over piston engines and are more reliable over the long term.  Anti-ship and land attack cruise missiles that were previously rocket powered have seen a great increase in range thanks to the development of “throttleable” turbine engines.   The component technologies developed in this activity are an important step in the development of an innovative highly efficient small turbine engine.  FTT’s alternative approach to today’s small turbojets offers significantly longer range for small turbine powered munitions.  Longer range will enable better accuracy which will reduce the number and overall cost of munitions and longer stand-off which will help to save lives.  Further the approach can be directly applied to a range of engine sizes and vehicle applications thereby providing significant benefit to all armed forces that utilize or anticipate the need for propulsion with lower fuel consumption.  The approach can also be applied to commercial land air and sea vehicles to reduce fuel consumption and emissions compared to today’s technology leading to improved air quality and reduced dependence on foreign fuel.","F2-5666","AF071-152","07.1",

A practical analysis and design tool is proposed for three-dimensional low-Reynolds-number flows.

On Phase I Foster-Miller successfully demonstrated joining monolithic Si3N4 to SiC/SiC CMCs using advanced brazing methods.  In Phase II Foster-Miller will team with GEAE to further develop these joining methods for CMC to CMC joining for the HPT nozzle.  The proposed program will develop the materials geometry and manufacturing of the braze to join a SiC/SiC leading edge to the SiC/SiC bands.  The Phase II program will culminate in full-size component fabrication at Foster-Miller and testing in GEAE's burner rig.    The development of the brazed hybrid airfoil nozzle joining will enable GEAE to meet its target weight and cost reduction goals for UAV engines for IHPTET and VAATE designs.

In Phase I we demonstrated the concept of non-linear per-pixel response compensation models with empirically derived coefficients that corrected the instantaneous sensor response over the span of likely operational conditions in which the sensor will be expected to perform.  FTI’s vision is one where sensor design ground test experiments and on-orbit checkout tasks are designed to promote pre-launch sensor calibration over the entire range of operating conditions expected in early on-orbit operations; the sensor is designed from the ground up to support an ORS mission.  In support of this vision during Phase II we will address the novel calibration needs of next generation of giga-pixel arrays by incorporating new computational Graphic Processor Unit technology into the workflow.  Furthermore we will construct an innovative Design of Experiment for collecting test data intelligently and efficiently.  We envision creating a software suite capable of supporting future space-based and airborne electro-optical infrared sensors where the demands of ORS and large/fast readout sensor arrays result in a challenging environment of data-rich time-critical operations.

The ultimate result of the implementation of the innovations produced by this Phase II effort will be in the increased probability of mission success in the immediate period after cover release.  In addition to the high visibility space-based surveillance remote sensing and interceptor missions FTI has identified civilian and military applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as being potential immediate application targets for this technology.

FSCX Inc.’s proposed concept will result in a design for a near-real time system to overcome the C2 deficiencies.

Heat in the coil is readily dissipated with air moving over both the inside and outside of the coil.  High electrical efficiency is achieved with the BLDC Stator Coil exhibiting over 90% efficiency. Cogging is eliminated. The back emf waveform is a sine wave. The thin wall of the Stator Coil allows a very narrow magnetic gap but with high copper packing density in the magnetic field. The coil has very low phase-to-phase resistance and inductance. The manufacturing precision creates an insignificant 0.3% variation of phase-to-phase resistance.

Prediction should allow for improved performance over existing approaches and/or the use of low-cost commercial off-the-shelf components in these systems.  One of the key components developed in the Phase I effort was a novel technique which we dubbed GAFFE to more efficiently estimate the velocity fields in turbulent flow scenarios.  In Phase II GAFFE will be used for system identification in the predictive control algorithms under development.  A detailed performance analyses will be conducted with high fidelity simulation tools to establish the effective performance envelope.  A real-time control architecture will be defined including identification of computer processors that may be used in real-time implementations of these algorithms.  Important applications of this work include space surveillance laser communications and weapons and remote sensing.  Real-time adaptive optics implementations are also critically important in ground-based astronomy.  BENEFIT:  The product of this research is a control architecture to optimally compensate for optical disturbances due to turbulence both free space and boundary layer in the presence of various noise sources.  Implementing this control scheme is obviously desirable in: 1) the development of laser weapons especially to Air Force programs such as ATL and 2) in providing defensive laser platforms on ships and military transport aircraft.  In addition the technologies developed here will also be useful in other adaptive optics applications such as laser communications remote sensing and astronomy.  Current UAVs have no need for this technology but existing UAVs such as Global Hawk Predator and Avenger are large enough to support adaptive optics in the future and may benefit from this technology.  Although the number of astronomical adaptive optics systems is quite small these systems are quite sophisticated and may greatly benefit from the work to be carried out in this proposal.","F2-5909","AF093-010","09.3",

This maintains minimal air inlet spill over drag for all combined flight /electrical loading conditions.        We have developed a small engineering prototype that has successfully demonstrated full function in wind tunnel tests at air speeds of up to 225 knots. This system has not yet been fully optimized to maximize performance and an estimated 30 % efficiency increase will be needed to reach the goal of 40 kW in a size compatible with the pod. Using the present prototype design as a test bed we will develop analytical models correlated with the experimental performance to study develop and experimentally verify design improvement strategies to increase the efficiency. Anticipated design improvements that will be addressed include a more streamlined center body thinner stator airfoils and twisting of the turbine blades.

The UHF band in SAR is particularly useful for this project because of its foliage penetration capability and although limited it also has proven ground penetration  capability. On the other hand LIDAR systems can provide both elevation and intensity records for each laser return leading to creation of high-resolution 3-D representation of objects on the terrain under surveillance. The primary goal of this project is combine integrate and exploit the respective strengths of these two different classes of sensors to identify small emplaced objects that can cause harm to our combat troops and innocent civilians. Advanced Change detection and Anomaly Detection algorithms will be employed for precise localization of specific terrain changes in multiple and single passes.  BENEFIT:  The successful completion of this research will result in the development of a robust collaborative trip-wire and small Detect/ID Change Detection and Sensor-Registration algorithms and associated system architecture capable of being integrated on an operational platform such as small UAVs.

Global Aircraft Corp.(GAC) has the  technology to design and manufacture composite propellers with scimitar shaped blades that flex to change pitch.  This ability to flex allows the propeller to provide high performance over a wide range of operating conditions.  This technology was developed under NASA SBIR and NASA AGATE funding.  The design process has been recently automated using a rules-based computer program that performs finite analysis of blade geometry to show the effect of operating condition on blade deflection and vibratory modes that must be addressed in a structurally sound propeller design.      	The objective of the proposed SBIR Phase I project is to design fabricate and test proof-of-concept propellers that produce 12 dB less noise than commercially available hobby industry 2-blade propellers.  The Phase II work is to further reduce the noise of the propeller developed in Phase I by 8 or more dB while maintaining performance within 5% of the Phase I design.    The proposed SBIR project will increase the knowledge base concerning the design of low-noise high-efficiency propellers for small UAVs.  This knowledge can be applied to the design of propellers for numerous military and industrial UAVs most of which currently use propellers designs based on seventy year old propeller technology.  The technology generated in this project is directly applicable to design and production of propellers for the model airplane industry and will result in much quieter and more efficient operations.

The architecture includes modules such as world and UGV modeling through an object-oriented framework health assessment through novel diagnostic and prognostic algorithms decision support through goal modification vehicle path planning and low-level control reconfiguration.  At the top level of the architecture the UGV mobility health state is assessed through diagnostic and prognostic failure detection identification and prediction system; an object-based world model is constructed describing terrain obstacles etc.; and a goal modification module determines appropriate control actions due to UGV mobility failures.  A path planner is then used at the mid-level to generate appropriate UGV mobility trajectories based on the world model and UGV health state.  At the low-level an adaptive controller continually estimates UGV model parameters to provide robust tracking of the generated path.  The proposed system will provide the remote UGV user with selectable path planning and operating mode options when mobility failures are present allowing for improved situational awareness prolonged vehicle life and greater mission success rates.  During Phase II we will develop a working prototype by first testing the system off-line with data collected from the facilities provided by Auburn University and data provided by our industrial partners for a wheel/hub/motor mobility subsystem.

This effort is concerned with single or dual receiver channel SAR data processing to detect track and image moving targets in real time.  For this purpose we propose a subaperture-based method via which a Moving Target Indicator (MTI) is generated based on a rapidly-formed range-azimuth image of the interrogated scene.  To improve the system sensitivity to detect subtle targets (such as dismounts) we propose the use of a nonlinear flight path. A nonlinear flight path also improves the system capability to detect targets that move at variety of directions.  This in turn provides a better estimate of the moving target velocity vector for tracking and imaging purposes. The subaperture processing not only reduces the size of the data for analysis but also is the key for the hardware (RF) implementation of the algorithm for persistent and staring-mode airborne radar.  Each individual subaperture data provide pertinent information regarding the moving targets in the imaging scene; however the data extracted from each of the subapertures could be combined to get a better understanding of the dynamics of the interrogated moving targets.

GT has successfully imaged F-15 radar data collected during a 4g maneuver and forward-looking synthetic-aperture sonar data (for shallow-water mine avoidance). GT is currently building a tiny mm-wave sensor prototype for side-looking SAR imaging from a small UAV. Phase I will include experiments with the microSAR(tm) equipment mounted on a test vehicle traveling over rough terrain. The data will be processed to obtain accurate elevation estimates 10 meters ahead of the sensor and the Phase II real-time terrain-mapping plow-control system will be defined.  BENEFITS:  Mine clearing operations via a remotely piloted plow vehicle such as the drive-by-wire Grizzly requires information to control plow depth under all visibility conditions. This sensor can also be used in civilian mine clearing and in earth and snow moving equipment. A similar sensor could provide look- ahead terrain data for an active suspension system in an off-road military vehicle or a civilian luxury sports-utility or emergency medical vehicle.

A typical transmitter must produce multi-kilowatt pulses but the efficiency of existing transmitters is only 20 to 30 percent.  Low efficiency results in transmitters that are unnecessarily large and heavy.  It also taxes the limited power available on a UAV and limits the capabilities of the UAV payloads.      GMRR proposes to develop a new high-efficiency transmitter for UHF radar.  Efficiency is achieved through a combination of high-efficiency power amplifiers (class D E or F) RF-power transistors (GaN or LDMOS) electronic tuning optimized combiners and signal processing and control.  The efficiency of this architecture is expected to be in the range of 60 to 70 percent. BENEFITS: This technology can be applied directly to UHF radars used for wind profiling and ground penetration (mine detection).  With the addition of a wide-band modulator it can be used in emerging UHF land-mobile and HDTV transmitters. With modification of the power amplifier for operation at higher frequencies it can be used in cellular base stations.  In all of these applications the new transmitter will offer efficiencies that are double to triple those of the currently available transmitters.  Other military applications include the JTRS manpacks and hand-held transmitters. ","N061-027-0089","N06-027","06.1",

(ie: JP-5 JP-8 DF-2) Subsonic airborne applications defined by maximum endurance and payload capacity require the HFE to have outstanding specific weight ratios below 1.5 lbs/hp as well as excellent fuel economy under .5 lbs/hp-hr. The air dropped mission scenario of the Powered Parafoil further complicates the HFE requirement of having to predictably start in-flight during the chute deployment at high altitude. This unattended cold start requirement is unique to the project and is the main focus of this phase I feasibility study/demonstration. The proposed high-speed multi-cylinder compression ignition (CI) diesel relies on cylinder pressure/temperature to self-ignite the fuel. High altitude starting is by an innovative low cost and robust variable compression mechanism with the assistance of conventional cold start aids. Current logistically available fuels have variable viscosity lubricity and cetane values that are critical factors to engine start up peak performance and endurance. The proposed approach incorporates an innovative high-speed diesel injection and combustion system that is specifically designed for multi-fuel operation.     The proposed effort matures a much-needed high speed multi-fuel diesel engine technology with high power density particularly well suited for airborne applications requiring specific weights of 1.5lbs/hp or better.

If the technology proposed for the Ka-band antenna applies to the L-/S-band antenna then it will weigh about 4#. The active T/R circuitry will be realized in MHEMT technology for low noise figure and high PA efficiency and low power dissipation.  Digital beam former circuits will be built in SiGe BiCMOS technology at IBM through DoD’s ITAR-compliant Trusted Foundry (TF) agreement.  Digital Sub-Arrays (DSAs) realized with wafer-scale antenna (WSA) technology will contain all the site-specific electronics for 64 radiating elements plus data conversion and digital beam forming.  True-time delay beam forming will minimize squint. The Phase I effort will focus on a Ka-band AESA.  The feasibility of realizing the AESA within the size weight and power (SWaP) constraints of a small UAV will be assessed. Critical circuitry will be developed during Phase II prior to fielding a complete antenna in Phase III. Interleaving the L-/S-band antenna will be considered separately.","D072-021-0179","SB072-021","07.2",

The  key ingredients of the guidance concept were: GPS position data of the  projectile and an up-link command to control the canard inserted in the  fuze well.  This system concept was developed with an assistance of  Alliant Techsystems who provided the concept for munitions control and  integration of the guidance package.  The operating scenario was analyzed  to determine RF performance parameters of the on-board RF equipment.  It is proposed that the on-board command guidance concept generated in  Phase I be fully developed.  The on-board guidance package consists of a  GPS frequency translator/downlink transmitter and an uplink receiver.   The GPS translator provides the position data of the projectile to the  ground station which sends a maneuvering command via the uplink.  The  uplink receiver generates control signals to canards mounted on the tip  of the projectile to correct the flight path.  The hardware delivered  will be compatible with a real-time maneuver firing demonstration.  The  hardware will be laboratory tested and evaluated prior to delivery.  In  addition the associated uplink transmitter will be supplied to  facilitate the demonstration testing.  Techniques to ECM-harden the  required command uplink will be evaluated and implemented into the  hardware to the extent possible.  As an option four fully functional  command guidance electronic packages capable of being test fired will be  delivered.  These units will be ruggedized to the required test-firing  G-levels and packaged in a manner compatible with integration into the  test rounds.  Also as part of this option Hittite will provide technical  support to other contractors/agencies to assist in a real-time  flight-maneuver demonstration as well as integration of the developed  hardware into existing test systems/facilities.  Miniaturized transceivers will find applications in un-manned platforms  (e.g. expendiles missiles UAVs) to meet generic requirements for  data-link and guidance/control.

Besides its large SWaP the dynamic range (i.e. ENOB) commercial equipment is inadequate for UWB TIS. With almost four to eight times more dynamic range the proposed Receiver/Digitizer will enable numerous types of UWB TIS equipment for a variety of ground-based and airborne operations specifically including handheld and UAV-borne UWB TISs.

However the rapid development of UAV capabilities in terms of sizes weapons sensors communications and flight ability is presenting a new challenge for these simulations. At the same time the general state of world affairs is changing such that the likelihood and impact of UAV’s in operations is greater than ever before.  Thus the ability to use effective computer modeling and analysis tools in decision-making at all levels is more critical than ever especially in the development of UAV doctrine tactics procurement design and integration into force structures and missions.

Additionally investigations will be made into improving the artificial intelligence (AI) abilities acting on behalf of both itself and/or a human player.   BENEFIT:  The primary benefits of the proposed model and AI improvements will be that existing and future combat simulations and computer wargames will be more accurate in terms of friendly and enemy force actions involving UAV’s will offer more challenges to players and will make them more enjoyable to use/play.

The RL+GP framework will scale up to realistic problems and will be analytically tractable. The proposed framework will also make it possible to conveniently incorporate domain-specific information giving it the capability to develop "customized" solutions to each problem at hand. We will also develop an Agent-Based simulator of swarms of UAVs and use the simulator as a testbed for the RL+GP framework. The simulator will allow testing of various sensor configurations specification of UAV missions and will include the ability to simulate a variety of normal and adverse scenarios. The simulator will also serve as a tool for visualization and for quantitative evaluation of the proposed framework or other flight control and sensory allocation technologies. The RL+GP framework combines the power of learning and of evolutionary computation but is analytically tractable and simplifies the process of encoding domain information more so than other adaptive frameworks.

The sensor is based on an innovative radar configuration made possible by the advanced data-adaptive motion compensation techniques developed by Imaging Microsensors Inc. The proposed sensor offers a low-cost all-weather high-resolution SAR imaging and MTI capability from such a small UAV for surveillance reconnaissance and targeting.     In a particular implementation the resulting sensor offers 0.1 m image resolution at a range of 10 km in clear weather (with graceful degradation in rain) and provides an MTI mode with 360 degree coverage. Approximately the sensor of the above example weighs 4.5 kg occupies 0.25 cubic feet and consumes 50 W of dc power with further weight size and power reductions possible through design optimization.     Phase I will develop the lightweight mm-wave SAR/MTI sensor concept and show its feasibility through the design of a flyable prototype. The design will be supported with detailed radar system analysis and computer simulation. In Phase II the prototype will be built and demonstrated through a flight test. The proposed lightweight SAR/MTI sensor provides all-weather imaging from a small UAV where tactical targets are naturally highlighted and precisely located in range and azimuth. A similar sensor onboard a low-cost UAV can be used by rescue squads in search and rescue missions under poor visibility conditions and by law enforcement agencies for drug interdiction and patrolling the borders of the USA.

Both conventional digital hardware and cellular nonlinear networks a massively parallel analog array processor with architecture much like the vertebrate retina will be considered for implementation.    The mammalian retina forms about a dozen different images representing feature sets derived from input stimuli and embodied in a set of stacked strata that span the depth of the inner plexiform layer. These representations are carried intact to higher visual centers by different populations of optic nerve fibers and comprise the complete set of abstracted images that we use to perceive the world and as such represent a rich feature space for vision. These features are then integrated through higher brain function to generate more comprehensive recognition capabilities.    We intend to develop image processing systems that will generate the same set of images that are formed by the natural retina on combine them to achieve robust detection discrimination and recognition functions.  We hope to learn why nature developed this representation and will use it to create feature detection and filtering systems with enhanced capabilities and compact implementation.

Advanced radar systems on large remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs) include Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Ground Moving Target Indicators (GMTI).  The ability to identify and track vehicles and dismounts has become a key focus.  Small (< 10 lb) radars with SAR imaging capabilities exist for RPAs but GMTI capabilities are not yet available on Tier I/II programs of record.  Incorporating dismount detection and tracking capabilities into small RPAs will be a significant force multiplier and improve the tactical commander’s Battlefield Awareness and is the focus of this Advanced Radar Concepts for Small RPAs program.    The Advanced Radar Concepts for Small RPAs Phase I program clearly demonstrates the feasibility of innovative approaches needed to bridge the gap between advanced weapon system radars and small Size Weight & Power (SWaP) radar systems that can operate on Tier I/II programs of record RPAs.  The objective of Phase II is to mature small SWaP GMTI technology and demonstrate real-time GMTI radar capabilities within the stringent SWaP constraints of these Teir I/II RPAs.    BENEFIT:  GMTI and dismount detection radar is a force multiplier that will help the tactical commander to dispel the fog of war and the uncertainty of ever changing battlefield conditions.  Pushing this important and proven technology down to the smallest RPAs will provide accurate and timely situational awareness information to commanders of forward operational bases and the small tactical units critical for the protection of personnel and concentration of force.    Moreover agencies responsible for border patrol law enforcement and search and rescue operations will benefit from this technology.  GMTI will improve their ability to efficiently search and patrol large areas.  They will be able to concentrate their efforts where it is most needed while minimizing risk to personnel.

Specific issues include: what should each BM/C2 node know in terms of models sensor data and overall system goals?  What algorithm is used by each node? How do the BM/C2 nodes coordinate their processing in order to avoid conflicts and achieve high performance?  What happens if there is latency in communication?  In this Phase I effort Information Extraction and Transport Inc. (IET) proposes to support the Ballistic Missile Defense-Decision Architecture (BMD-DA) efforts to build a generic BM/C2 decision architecture by developing algorithms that allow multiple cooperating BM/C2 nodes (agents) to coordinate their decisions to achieve near-optimal performance in a distributed BM/C2 architecture.   These algorithms are designed to estimate and communicate the impact of evidence on object classification using learned Bayesian network factoring of posterior joint likelihood distributions.  We will also develop algorithms that estimate the performance of learned Bayesian network factorings these posterior joint likelihoods.  The result will be an experimental harness where we will demonstrate the feasibility and utility of using learned Bayesian network factorings of posterior joint likelihoods to support efficient distributed situation assessment and dissemination.  Information Extraction and Transport Inc. (IET) anticipates that benefits from Phase I of the proposed SBIR effort include: 1) a methodology for learning a set of Bayesian networks that represent the posterior joint likelihood over a set of variables that are shared by BMDS elements; 2) measures for the impact of evidence on a BMDS' system model and for estimating the resources and bandwidth requirements given a particular Bayesian network for the posterior joint likelihood; 3) a strategy for choosing the best learned network structure given the evidence available resources and impact; 4) an approach for updating the system model at a remote BMDS element given the selected Bayesian network for the posterior joint likelihood; and 5) an experimental harness to support the evaluation of this approach.  The technology proposed has significant commercial application.  The market for battlespace sensor control and processing software will be significant within the DOD and Intelligence Community.  Critical mission areas that could be supported include force protection facility monitoring and mobile target tracking.  Commercial sensor markets could benefit as well including applications using microsatellites terrestrial and extraterrestrial robotics and unmanned vehicles (e.g. UAVs and UUVs).","B031-1295","MDA03-009","03.1",

We propose to mitigate the false alarm rate problem the so-called large-N problem posed by the AADS that arises through the use of a large number of small inexpensive sensors in place of fewer larger more expensive sensors by applying distributed data fusion technology.  In our proposed approach each sensor node communicates with neighboring nodes in terms of statistics such as likelihood functions or a posteriori probabilities conditioned only on the local data rather than by making local decisions. Those local statistics are then fused together to produce collaborative global situation assessment and decisions maintaining collective optimality.    We propose to build upon IET''''s state-of-the-art inference and decision-making solution techniques developed to support computation with Bayesian and decision networks into the self-organizing distributed data fusion infrastructure for the AADS development.  IET has formulated its approach in concert with its research institution partner Professor Kuo-Chu Chang of George Mason University''''s Department of Systems Engineering and Operations Research (GMU-SEOR). Professor Chang is a widely recognized expert in data fusion and decision network technology. He has recently developed a novel solution for real-time decision network solutions.

By combining this network of tactical MAVs and the loiter and in-flight targeting capabilities of the Block IV Tomahawk cruse missile an opportunity exists to develop a new weapon system that combines persistent ISR targeting and strike of time critical targets. The ISL/Raytheon team envisions a system for which a user located anywhere in the world can analyze MAV sensor data provided over the FORCEnet to track identify and strike high value and time critical enemy targets.","N052-114-0222","N05-114","05.2",

This coating protects metal engine components against sand-particle abrasion corrosion and thermal fluctuations in extreme conditions. By combining a unique coating morphology rapid deposition process and substrate-matched thermal properties the ERC system promotes excellent adhesion prevents stress buildup and eliminates high-cycle fatigue more efficiently than currently available coatings.

EAP offers (1) distributed actuation (2) easy conformance to the shape of an airfoil (3) high spatial and temporal bandwidths and (4) the ability to both deliver and harvest energy from the flow field. Phase I included design manufacture and integration of EAP actuators into a wind tunnel test article. At appropriate frequencies a substantial reduction of the laminar separation bubble size was observed. Phase II will employ both experimental and computational efforts to identify EAP-based flow control strategies that result in desirable integral properties i.e. maximal lift lift-to-drag ratio and minimal drag. For our experiments stereo PIV measurements; static and dynamic surface pressure measurements; direct integral aerodynamic measurements; and flow visualization will be employed whereas the computational efforts will rely on CFD simulation. In order to perform the experiments and demonstrate feasibility we will undertake critical engineering issues:  optimization of the EAP polymer manufacture of EAP flow control actuators with spatially-selective control of the actuator cells and demonstrate that electronics can meet the power and energy requirements within the very limited size and weight budgets of MAVs.   BENEFIT:  Distributed surface actuation with electro-active polymer for the purposes of managing the boundary layer can improve the range and endurance of proposed small UAVs and may ultimately represent a means to reduce drag and delay stall in commercial and military aircraft.

When small satellites (ORS tactical s/c CubeSats etc.) are considered the technology becomes even more critical since Size Weight and Power (SWaP) are at such a premium.  Currently there are no Type 1 certified encryption units that are small enough for use on CubeSat-size space systems which greatly restricts the utility of their architecture.    Over the past several years Innoflight has developed a series of Encryption Control Unit (ECU) prototypes for CubeSat through MiniSat applications.  This development has culminated with the production of the first Innoflight Miniature End Cryptographic Unit (MECU).  This highly integrated ‘smart’ component is based on National Security Agency (NSA) Suite B cryptography using the AES256 algorithms.  This first non-certified flight MECU is scheduled to fly on an Air Force weather nanosatellite SENSE early in CY2013.  In this proposed SBIR project Innoflight is leveraging multiple efforts both internally and externally to build on this existing development by updating and completing Type 1 certification of the MECU optionally available with an integrated CCSDS/AFSCN-compatible transceiver by the conclusion of Phase 2.    BENEFIT:  Anticipated Benefits:  1) Provide a low SWaP Type 1 certified cryptographic unit for small spacecraft by the end of Phase 2  2) Provide an integrated Radio Aerospace Vehicle Equipment (AVE) that is compatible with existing ground networks including both AFSCN / SGLS and CCSDS  /////  Potential Commercial Applications:  1) The MECU can be used to provide encryption or a full secure communications system for DoD CubeSats and virtually any SmallSat  2) The MECU also can be used for NASA small spacecraft which represent national assets that require secure communications  3) Some commercial small space missions also will be interested in low-SWaP secure communications systems such as that provided by the MECU  4) Launch vehicles and missiles can utilize the MECU and integrated radio to provide secure communications at Low SWaP as well  5) This technology is directly applicable to similar remotely operated vehicles such as UAVs  ","F121-070-2221","AF121-070","12.1",

This effort will transform multiple spacecraft into networked vehicles which have high performance secure networkable communications to each other and through to the ground segment user.   Our efforts will advance the transformation of tactical spacecraft by supporting net-centric operations and rapid integration of PnP spacecraft consistent with the satellite data model approach.  It will also unleash the capability to host and serve many applications on one vehicle consistent with modern systems.  Last it will enable mission designers to operate over any IP network (Internet SIPRNet Classified WANs) as a black core without the need for specialized dedicated bandwidth sensitive transport infrastructure.  BENEFIT:  Anticipated benefits of the SBIR Phase II include: 1) Seamless space networked communications (end-to-end) with HAIPE security 2) Lower cost mission operations ground stations and communications infrastructure 3) Rapid spacecraft development and integration 4) DoD Type 1 plug-n-play enabled space and ground appliances for operations over a black core 4) Multi-protocol spacecraft applications and 5) The use of established IP networks for distributed net-centric operations. The customers for this technology include every branch of the military (and their supporting research and development agencies and institutions) since each one provides systems or relies on systems that communicate from space.  To increase the market size our technology extends very well to UAV systems as they require high reliability highly autonomous communication links along with network centric operations within the theater and from space.  A UAV can simply be enabled as a node in a secure network (similar to the remote tracking station) and be equipped with the communications appliance to receive critical data or information from a satellite above.   The fact that our proposed technology is founded on open standards and plug-n-play will open our commercialization capabilities significantly as numerous DoD agencies and NASA ARC are looking to AFRL’s SPA efforts to drive down the cost and increase the responsiveness of space missions.  Our primary target is the DoD small satellite (most notably CubeSats) and Operationally Responsive Space (e.g. TACSAT) market which includes research development and demonstration programs from DARPA MDA AFRL SMC and NRO.  CubeSats have a lot to gain from this technology due to the fact that a cluster swarm or tight formation of CubeSats is basically mandatory in order to qualify as a significant DoD mission.  It is expected that these CubeSats form a network to enable sensor collaboration autonomous reconfiguration shared computing and a host of other capabilities enabled in a network centric architecture.  Similarly DARPA''s F6 program will gain from this technology.  The emergence of these missions and ORS’s staunch support of open standards and plug-n-play indicates the awareness that National Security objectives can be met through low-earth orbiting small spacecraft and more responsive missions.   NASA''s Constellation Program is another prominent customer for this technology especially the ability to establish robust long distance networking capabilities for lunar systems including the implementation of IPsec – potentially with the need for NSA certified HAIPE solutions. Last but certainly not least when it comes to commercialization potential future net-centric space secure communications demonstrate a significant and emerging demand for a Type 1 IP-based space solution.  The space communicatons network of 2020 will rely on IP-based HAIPE enabled systems much like the ones that Innoflight proposes to demonstrate in this effort.","F2-5308","AF083-221","08.3",

Although the equipment is intended for operation from a manned helicopter the next generation of such equipment is expected to operate from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Such platforms are anticipated to provide less payload and power than is available from the current helicopter platform. The single biggest subsystem in terms of weight and power consumption in the current system is the laser and its associated environmental conditioning equipment (ECS). Therefore we propose to evaluate novel laser design concepts that incorporate: a high-temperature diode pumping (optimized for 50 degrees C or more); an efficient pump head design with optimum coupling to the matching solid-state laser media; distributed thermal load design; efficient and high beam quality cavity; and solid-state frequency doubling to produce 500-540 nm blue-green laser output. The theoretical design including distributed thermal management and the blue-green laser output performance will be predicted using commercially proven modeling software. During Phase I based on the theoretical modeling we propose to design develop and test a proof-of-principle high-temperature limited energy diode-pumped solid-state laser oscillator head a scaled down thermoelectric (TE) cooling array an optimized fin air-to-air heat exchanger platform for the limited energy oscillator as well as scaled down water-to-air heat exchanger and heat distributor/regulator subassemblies.  The test data collected will allow fine tuning of the theoretical software models and will assure the scalability of the Phase I design models to support Phase II and Phase III laser system requirements. The finalized Phase I design concept and the theoretical modeling will first support the design development and production of the Phase II prototype laser system. Phase I program results and validated theoretical modeling for the design should allow the Phase II laser system to have at least 4 watts of 500-540 nm output at a pulse repetition rate suitable for meeting present AN/AES-1 technology insertion requirements of 100-400 Hz.  Additionally the Phase II laser system will meet all safety criteria established in ANSI Z136.1-2000 for military exempt lasers. Laboratory demonstration of this complete laser system will be structured to demonstrate full functionality over the intended temperature range of 0-120 degrees F (-18 to 49 degrees C). During Phase I and Phase II additional theoretical software models will be developed for the design and development of a larger scale amplifier network which will show how the developed technology can be scaled to 40 watts of blue-green output at higher pulse repetition rates of up to 400 Hz suitable for meeting   AN/AES-1 technology insertion requirements. Although diode-pumped lasers with the properties described above have been demonstrated for R&D and limited commercial applications considerable development is especially required to build the robust systems that would be needed for the Phase III effort to include the laser as a P3I replacement for the current laser in the AN/AES-1 and/or for the follow-on program for operating an AN/AES-1 capability from a UAV. Our SBIR Phase I proposal incorporates all state-of-the art laser and thermal management technologies and it is intended for design development and production of a solid-state blue-green laser that can meet the needs of such air-cooled blue-green laser system requirements of the United States Navy.

The MAV is attracted to the end of the tether via a signal transmitting the GPS location altitude and trajectory information.  Once closing in on the trap the MAV makes its final approach via vision based detection and targeting.  The MAVTRAP is composed of a parachute type device and small streamers or a small net that ensnares the MAV.  We have found that the propeller of an MAV will snag a streamer and wind it on the propeller hub.  This is the preferred method to capture the MAV since the control surfaces of the MAV are free to continue to guide the vehicle.  The thrust of the propeller is thus replaced by the pull of the streamer.","F08A-014-0030","AF08-T014","08.A",

BENEFIT:  The commercialized recovery system will allow for swarms of MAVs to be deployed to perform immediate aerial coverage of large areas. This capability is not currently available without incurring large costs for equipment and personnel.  Military uses of these systems can include target acquisition/tracking aerial recharging and under cloud cover aerial mapping.

Specifically our team will develop a portable open system architecture for a highly mobile efficient ad-hoc communication protocol that will support the LEWK program.  Due to the limited bandwidth to carry network control traffic and the dynamics of mobile nodes conventional routing protocols are not suitable for application in tactical networks. In Phase I of the STTR Innovative Concepts investigated the various mobile network architectures and routing algorithms that could be suitable for operation in a highly mobile tactical environment. Our investigation revealed the existence of extensive research in the area of ad-hoc networks both in academia and in the wireless industry. The characteristics shown to be required by the ad-hoc networking research (connectivity preventing congestion frequency management mobile routing quality of service security multicasting and addressing) substantially correspond with the requirements and characteristics of the highly mobile tactical networks described in this proposal Once we select and successfully demonstrate an ad-hoc algorithm that meets all the criteria/specifications described in this proposal Innovative Concepts will take the next logical step and port that protocol to our IDM TechnologyT offerings.

Ice accretion during cold weather operations can cause increased drag and loss of lift and potentially lead to a crash.  Current de-icing technology does not exist for this category aircraft due to the small airfoil sizes and low electrical power available.  Under a Phase I SBIR program Innovative Dynamics Inc. (IDI) demonstrated the feasibility of applying state-of-the-art ice detection and de-icing technology to an integrated UAV system for autonomous operation.  Candidate ice detection and de-icing prototype equipment was installed on various UAV wing sections and tested in the NASA Lewis Icing Research Tunnel for overall performance evaluation.  Based on the results obtained a closed-loop system design concept was presented for current mission specific UAV's as well as for future long duration advanced UAV designs. IDI is proposing a Phase II demonstration program to further develop test integrate and qualify a UAV for flight into known icing conditions.  The program will focus on both airframe and powerplant ice protection systems.  The system will be controlled automatically by the De-Icing Control Unit (DCU) which will function as the de-icing controller and interface to the UAV control system.  The program will consist of two major task groups or line items:  UAV closed-loop system demonstration and UAV flight testbed qualification.  IDI is proposing to team with AAI corporation and use the Pioneer short range UAV as the testbed for this Phase II demonstration program.  At the conclusion IDI will deliver a known icing qualified UAV testbed as well as the capability to produce ice protection system hardware for the short range UAV fleet. Anticipated Benefits:  Development of a closed-loop UAV ice protection system will spin-off the first advanced de-icing technology for general aviation business and commuter aircraft in 50 years.  Over a dozen experimental and GA aircraft manufacturers currently undergoing FAA certification are candidates for advanced aicraft de-icing technology.

In order to start the engine an Air Turbine Starter is required. Since the UAV does not have an Auxiliary Power Unit on board this engine could only be started on the ground. This means that in case of a flame out this aircraft could be lost. Therefore the ability to start the engine in the air would contribute significantly to the UAV survivability. Furthermore if the starter could also start the engine on the ground we could eliminate the ATS and save significant weight and cost.  Innovative Power Solutions is proposing to develop a brushless Starter/Generator capable of starting the AE3007 engine as well as supplying 500 Amps at 28 VDC. This generator will replace the current 200 Amp 28 VDC brush type generator which requires periodic (less than 1000 hours) overhauling. A Starter/GCU will control this generator. During the start mode the start converter will control the start sequence that will be tailored to the engine requirements. The GCU will control the generator during the power generation mode. Other significant improvements are extended life due to matching torque/speed curve to start sequence and reduced maintenance requirements.    The effort described in this proposal has a significant opportunity for commercialization in both the commercial and military aerospace market.  Northrop Grumman has received orders to build at least 50 Global Hawk aircraft.  This presents an immediate application for the technology discussed herein.  Additionally since IPS has been working to develop this and improve its starter generator technology IPS has been searching and marketing the product.  Other applications that may become available are on the Embrear aircraft which also uses the AE3007.

These inefficiencies mostly stem from generator core and copper losses eddy current losses and mechanical losses (bearings rotating seals and windage). These inefficiencies raise the generator temperature mostly the stator and rotor as well as increase the aircraft heat load requiring larger and heavier heat exchanging systems.  Heat which is the direct product of inefficiency is the main reason for limiting generator output. The insulating and encapsulating materials inside the generator are limited to operating at a maximum temperature of 220ºC. Therefore the key to increasing power density lies in improving efficiency and improving cooling. Improved efficiency is the outcome of the generator electromagnetic design combined with the type of cooling method chosen for the specific application. IPS has developed several oil cooled generators utilizing improved cooling techniques to maximize power density. IPS has a patent for cooling rotors in conduction oil cooled generators.

Achievement of such a system through application of conventional interferometric or sparse aperture techniques has been shown impractical for many potential applications. This is due to the inherent difficulty of simultaneously satisfying field of view (FOV) and image quality requirements while also maintaining acceptable weight power and computational limits - this is especially true for satellites and UAV platforms. In response IR&T has developed an innovative solution to this severe limitation through the use of an "electronic mirror". The Phase I/II Program will demonstrate for the first time the new concept of a beam-steerable sparse array imaging interferometer for application to millimeter-wave radiometric imaging. The electronic mirror allows fewer higher gain elements thereby reducing the overall antenna weight power consumption and data analysis complexity. The electronic mirror provides the necessary control to increase the FOV while also providing flexibility to optimize image acquisition and quality in varying weather and tactical situations. The electronic mirror consists of an array of monolithic solid-state varactor diodes together with antennas and bias lines. The incident electromagnetic wave is steered through a progressive phase shift introduced across the array through a simple bias voltage. Monolithic fabrication results in the low-cost high reliability essential for both the proposed military as well as commercial applications.

The detection of toxic chemicals is possible if the vapors pass between a source of infrared energy and a sensor capable of measuring the thermal change associated with the absorption of infrared energy at specific frequencies. The breadboard detection system utilizes a MEMS photonic band gap foil that is ion etched to emit broadband infrared energy in the LWIR region. The sensor utilizes a microbolometer array with cutoff filters tuned to pass thermal energy at narrowly defined frequencies. The selected frequencies will correspond to those that are known absorption peaks for the chemical agents of interest. If a chemical agent enters the cell energy is absorbed at specific frequencies that are detected by the tuned microbolometers as a temperature change. If these temperature changes correspond to the known absorption peaks for specific chemical agents an alarm is sounded. The resulting system is very small solid state and thus very rugged does not require periodic maintenance or personnel involvement in operation and will not false alarm when encountering non-toxic gasses.  Development of this Multi-Mission Chemical Sensor will result in an extremely rugged device capable of being employed via non-traditional means. These include emplacement via launch and dissemination from a projectile dropping from a UAV or operation while mounted on a small robotic vehicle.  The design will enable interface with other components such as GPS receivers and RF communications modules allowing non line of sight operations. Commercial usage would include monitoring critical areas such as subways Government buildings and stadiums.

Insitu performed extensive research with Australian Macquarie University and the Cooperative Research Centre for Australian Mineral Exploration regarding the placement of magnetic sensors onboard Insitu's Aerosonde.  Moreover Insitu collected extensive data to better understand the necessary spatial separation and compensation needed to effectively operate magnetic sensors as part of integrated UAV systems.  This research along with Insitu's UAV leadership position highly qualifies Insitu as an ideal candidate to pursue SBIR N03-138.    Insitu has performed significant UAV development work and is approaching commercialization of its maritime UAV Seascan.  Seascan the daughter of Insitu's Aerosonde - known as the first UAV to successfully cross the Atlantic Ocean - is designed as a low-cost long endurance autonomous vehicle with integrated sensors.  The third UAV in Insitu's family of aircraft is Boeing's ScanEagle - a derivative of Seascan created through a development agreement with Boeing's Unmanned Systems Group.  Insitu UAVs have logged thousands of flight hours and hundreds of recoveries using Insitu's patented Skyhook system - a ship-based vertical arrestment system.  Furthermore ScanEagle will be actively involved in Giant Shadow a January 2003 Navy Exercise demonstrating UAV and UUV support during a Navy Seal mission.    SBIR N03-138 aligns perfectly with The Insitu Group's corporate direction and mission.  As UAVs continue to prove operational effectiveness future military operations will be significantly enhanced and additional commercial applications will be defined.  It is important for UAV developers to understand both the commercial and military applications and requirements for UAVs.  The Insitu Group believes careful integration of on-board sensors is a critical requirement in its product development.  Stand-alone sensors not integrated with the rest of the aircraft can cause additional unneeded weight and demand more resources than integrated sensors. This is a significant issue as UAVs continue to reduce in size while missions require longer endurance.  As with Insitu's Seascan the onboard EO sensor is a fully integrated package and it is Insitu's desire to leverage its experience with magnetic sensors and UAVs to provide a similar solution as part of SBIR N03-138.    Another key aspect of UAVs for the Navy and commercial applications is the ability for near-vertical takeoff and vertical recovery to support maritime operations.  Thus vehicles must be able to make short field or catapult takeoffs and nearly-vertical recoveries in a very controlled manner.  These launches and recoveries are very likely to occur in a maritime environment where the deck space is pitching and both weight and space is extremely limited.  Additionally before and after flights it will be necessary to control the movement of UAV assets with ease and precision in an unsettled environment.  Insitu's Skyhook a vertical arrestment recovery system allows for this type of operation in a safe and effective manner.  This gives UAVs with on-board magnetic sensors the ability to perform Air Anti-Submarine Warfare anyplace anytime.    Commercial applications for Insitu's recovery system fall into three initial market segmentations: environmental commercial fishing and military/homeland security.  The applications within these three segments are off-shore avoiding restrictions presented by the Federal Aviation Administration.  The environmental industry market includes Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions as well as data collection and monitoring for weather forecasting iceberg tracking fisheries pollution economic zones and coasts wildlife pipeline fire detection and sea life.  Most if not all of these applications will require maritime launch and recovery of UAVs.    A primary commercial market for Insitu is providing ship-based launch and recovery UAVs to commercial fishing fleets.  Early-adopter customer discussions are already underway.  Commercial fishing currently performs fish reconnaissance as well as reconnaissance of fishing systems by helicopter - a costly inefficient and often unsafe mode of operation.  UAVs can provide a more cost-effective solution using low-cost long endurance autonomous UAVs such as Insitu's Seascan to provide an enhancement to data collection on fish schools while also providing a significantly safer environment.    The military and homeland security market is an important market segment to The Insitu Group.  In this rapidly developing market The Insitu Group can help create innovation in applications such as: tracking "targets of interest" monitoring economic zones and coastal patrol search and rescue drug interdiction opposition force simulation ISR covert target acquisition target laser illumination and geomagnetic and atmospheric surveys.  Maritime launch and recovery is critical in order to perform these type of operations anytime anyplace at a moments notice.  In an effort to enter this market The Insitu Group has entered into an agreement with Boeing to develop the Boeing ScanEagle.  ","N031-1719","N03-138","03.1",

In Phase I-Base the IABSRI will use Axiomatic Design scientific principles for complex interactions among the operational threads to formulate the MMF paradigm. From the MMF paradigm IABSRI will model the ontology for matching the military assets to the mission.  The IABSRI will then create the knowledge base for matching the military assets with the capabilities requirements to any mission tasks.

Compared with other attempts to develop this capability this device will have superior background noise rejection higher accuracy smaller size lower power consumption and greater ruggedness.      This capability is based on Integrated Wave Technology Inc.'s unique robust miniaturized language-independent speech recognition that allows for near-100 percent accurate command/control/information input in noise environments ranging from 0 to 100dB.      IWT designs and produces integrated hardware/software modules that filter and process sound energy match samples with stored templates using a 17-band analysis and direct actions based upon accurate recognitions.      The one-ounce integrated hardware/software modules remove large amounts of in-band and out-of-band background noise.  The modules are also have ultra-low internal noise allowing them to recognize sound more effectively than other systems.  The effectiveness has been demonstrated in a series of US Government-sponsored tests.  The device will be highly rugged capable of surviving and performing in duty with combat forces and recognizing speech made under duress.    IWT has developed both speaker dependent and speaker independent systems and will build representative articles of each technology for this effort.     This system will enhance significantly the performance of C4I systems and subsystems by enabling real-time eyes-free hands-free data input and command/control from observers/designators in any selected language.  This will provide a more effective interface between a forward observer and communications/data input devices.      Further by enabling forward observers or other personnel to maintain their visual surveillance this system will provide several benefits.  First the observer will be able to input information much more quickly than by using other interfaces.  Second the observer/designator will be able to maintain eye contact with surveillance subjects and targets reducing the chance that contact will be lost.  Third the observer/designator will be able to see threats to himself more easily and increase his survivability because he is not breaking eye contact.    In the case of a UAV operator this system will allow the user to control simultaneously core aircraft operations using traditional hand controls while operating surveillance weapons and other systems using highly precise and reliable voice control.      IWT's unique proven capability to achieve high noise immunity near-100 percent accuracy very low power consumption and miniaturization form the basis for this new capability.

TCP Westwood (TCPW) extends the standard TCP for more efficient congestion control and serves as the base for Agile Probing and Bulk Repeat. TCPW with Agile Probing (TCPW-A) achieves better performance under highly dynamic environment and TCP Bulk Repeat (TCP BR) brings about enhanced TCP/IP communications in heavy error scenarios. Further TCP Probe extends directly from TCP for the purpose of capacity estimation. Buffering mechanism is inherently included in TCP if the data on SHARP should be buffered locally; on the other hand we also describe the scenario where surveillance data is sent to some intermediate node (e.g. balloon or UAV). In this case the intermediate node serves as the TCP endpoint for SHARP buffers data from possibly multiple sources and is responsible for reliable data transmission to the ground station. The proposed framework and related TCP/IP enhancement mechanisms provide a valuable toolbox that facilitates optimized TCP/IP communications on SHARP for better usage of surveillance data.BENEFITS: The proposed framework and the various mechanisms provide an innovative and solid solution for enhancing TCP/IP in dynamic wireless networks. Our scheme significantly enhances the understanding and system design for solving TCP/IP performance problems and achieves integrated efficient and reliable TCP/IP communications for the military communication needs including war-time command and control surveillance and control and homeland security etc. The market for military applications is quite large. Other potential commercial applications include border and coast patrol law enforcement agency emergency control center and various civil applications possibly with huge amount of users. The size of this market is quite large and hard to estimate. In particular the increasingly popular wireless ad hoc and sensor networks will certainly benefit from our work and they provide great opportunities for commercialization. We expect that the aggregate market size will be similar to or larger than that of military applications.","N061-019-0543","N06-019","06.1",

There is an absence of novel and extensible multiple-RPA control and management architectures which would enable clear understanding of the operational implications of the interactions between human and machine in continuous long-term and complex operations. Our innovation is Multi-Con: a novel extensible agent-based architecture for the management and control of multiple remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs) employing state-of-the-art multi-modal technologies for urban warfare. Multi-Con is flexible and extensible to accommodate both new capabilities of existing RPAs and novel RPAs in the future. Multi-Con includes (1) an integrated architecture employing various functionally-connected constituent components  (2) an investigation of the crosscutting technologies for the underlying algorithms the information flow and control flow and the communication interface and protocols among the components (3) the development of a suitable scenario for proof-of-feasibility and (4) a trade study to compare candidate solutions and present performance metrics for the evaluation of multi-RPA control systems. We will explore the connection of Multi-Con with the funding agency’s existing technologies/programs to achieve the openness generality and interoperability of the proposed technology.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated Phase I results will provide a flexible and extensible architecture Multi-Con which manages its potentially heterogeneous RPA devices effectively and integrates state-of-the-art MMI technologies. This project addresses a huge market that faces this challenge: a single operator must control multiple distributed RPAs for continuous long-term complex missions. The functionalities of Multi-Con could be componentized possibly as plug-ins and ported to many various domains and existing systems. We have identified initial transition paths for Phase I II and further stages.

Drawing on state-of-the-art image processing methodologies the hybrid solution offers the flexibilities of an Eulerian approach and the natural advantages of a Lagrangian one. In order to handle dynamic perimeter topologies we characterize the boundary of the region to be monitored as a level set of the evolving function. To ensure validity of data within the region the robots measure values of the quantity of interest and maintain and propagate an estimate of the evolving function through a finite-element mesh. Every vertex in this mesh corresponds to a moving robot whose trajectories are described in a Lagrangian manner. A key aspect of the proposed innovation is a distributed agent-based implementation of the hybrid-level set algorithm for tracking and propagation of the information across the mesh. We represent the communication between the robots using an ad hoc mobile network and describe a mechanism that handles data collection even when connections between specific robots are broken.   With the increasing threat of use of chemical and biological weapon the need for technology to identify mark out and track regions of possible harm has increased. The proposed approach to perimeter surveillance provides a solution to address this problem. The generality of the approach makes it viable for implementation on swarms of various types of robotic vehicles. Depending on the application the algorithms can be implemented on UGVs to track mine fields surface and underwater vehicles to detect oil spills or even UAVs to aerially track chemical or oil spills or to track large crowds or troop movement.

In Phase I the goal is to implement such software and prove its feasibility of detecting and classifying real-world events. The algorithms must be able to identify these events within a noisy and complicated background.  Since the detection needs of the different potential applications are so diverse different algorithms may need to be applied to the same data streams in order to detect different classes of features. The features extracted from individual data source and algorithm will require the integration.  All of these features will need to be integrated together to achieve a robust stable detection of real-world events. One potential application is to improve the spectral analysis with data sources from multiple spectral bandpass filters that capture a mixture of spectral signatures from the target.  IFOS will identify more applications required by MDA and provide optimized system design based on findings. These applications may include multi spectral analysis robotic control Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGCV).","B044-118-0115","MDA04-118","04.4",

IFOS proposes to develop an innovative fiber-optic gyroscope (FOG) with requisite LTS features from a light-weight compact and low-cost device that can sustain vibration and shock environments typical of inertial navigation platforms. Phase I feasibility experiments conducted with an open-loop FOG prototype comprising new fiber components demonstrated excellent LTS potential. Size weight and power (SWaP) trade-off study provided guidance for a cost-effective FOG instrument with very small footprint. In Phase II IFOS proposes to implement its innovative designs and packaging techniques through optimization of FOG elements (both the optical head and electronics). IFOS will construct a complete 3-axis FOG subsystem engineering prototype for Air Force use The proposed FOG will be demonstrated to requirements including <0.1° bias drift over extended time temperature range and simulated vibration and shock environment. IFOS has assembled a multidisciplinary team of expert collaborators including major prime contractors to guide the FOG testing and integration within a complete Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The outcome of this project is expected to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in the open-loop FOG architecture.  BENEFIT:  IFOS’s FOGs will directly benefit Air Force platforms that require low SWaP high-resolution and/or long term platform stabilization and will also be useful for terrestrial and airborne applications including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); shipborne; and highly mobile ground platforms programs. Other potential DoD applications include advanced tactical fighter (eg F-22) NGAM (Next-Generation Ageis Missiles) PTSS (Precision Tracking Space System) ABL (Airborne Laser) and ALTB (Airborne Laser Test Bed) systems ABIR (Airborne Infrared) THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) and STSS (Space Tracking and Surveillance System). NASA’s future space exploration missions can also benefit from the IFOS FOGs. While FOGs for platform stabilization will be the focus of IFOS's efforts in the near term we expect that this technology will ultimately benefit FOGs for robotic systems such as future versions of the DOD’s Big Dog program as well as FOGs for commercial aircraft inertial navigation systems (INS) and Stabilization of parts used for pointing on moving and/or stationary platforms.

For hardware we designed a thin small size  light weight onboard DOA hardware system with very low power consumption equipped with fast signal capture capability (within 200ms). The designed DOA receiver has high dynamic range  and can cover a very wide frequency range at min power consumption(A typical 1200mWh battery can support over 5 hour flight mission with 11800 DOA estimations ). For the software part we have developed the smart antenna calibration hierarchical delay and sum (DAS) DOA estimation and terrain data aided DOA fusion 3D localization. We also constructed a 3D simulation and visualization tool by integrating the hardware design signal processing software algorithms and UAS flight controls. With a real terrain map we conducted the simulation and obtained the desired results of 100m accuracy. The system can track dual targets within a second in a typical application and may take a few more seconds in a difficult condition. In Phase II we plan to coordinate with government POCs and industrial partners on research and development.

One of the key aspects of this theory is granulation which will allow agents to process imprecise information in large complex state spaces. In complex and uncertain environments autonomous agents will need to adapt the initial definitions of granules and perception structures according to new information received from the environment. We propose a general Perception-based Reinforcement Learning framework for dynamically adapting strategic decisions about motion and sensor management in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). As a motivating example we will consider a reconnaissance mission by UAVs with the goal of identifying and tracking relevant targets. Such a mission requires sensor allocation at two levels: the individual UAV and the team-wide allocation. At the individual level the total available UAV sensor resources need to be dynamically allocated to tracking appearing and disappearing targets. At the team level each UAV is treated as a composite sensor and these composite sensors need to be allocated to different regions of the search space in proportion to the density and importance of targets there. In Phase I of this research we will study the feasibility of co-evolutionary adaptation of individual and team-level sensor allocation policies. The algorithm for allocating UAV sensor resources to dynamically appearing targets can be applied with minor modifications to many resource allocation problems in telecommunication networks e.g. call admission in circuit switched networks and multimedia flow allocation under DiffServ QoS paradigm in the Internet. The team level algorithm for allocating UAVs to different regions of the search space can be used in distributed dynamic load balancing e.g. moving cached content on the Web closer to "hot spots."","N023-0070","N02-T016","02  ",

To promote rapid acquisition and effective use of relevant HSCB knowledge we propose ACE-HSCB which automates HSCB data collection by a fleet of autonomous unmanned tactical ISR platforms (UAVs UGVs etc.).

The I3C BLOS SA/CID system provides real-time reporting and identification of visual imagery communications and radar signals intercepted by an airborne platform equipped with light weight sensors and interrogation devices in addition to navigation and platform controls and data link.  The innovative approach proposed by I3C will is to consider two options for low cost yet high confidence QAF.  One option is a dedicated low power narrowbeam microwave system while the second is a VHF interrogator that covers a wide area of interest and uses existing vehicle systems (e.g. SINGARS)for response.  The use of a simple 'applique unit' to be attached to friendly vehicles to utilize their existing SINCGARS radios for QAF response would reduce procurement costs to implement this portion of the BLOS system.  However the development of a dedicated microwave transponder would eliminate any integration requirements on the ground vehicle.  We will model the use of a unique transponder concept that simply modulates the interrogation RF pulse train which is manually set for the "code of the day" and is repeated back to the interrogator to be recognized for indication of status to be relayed to the ground controller station that the target is either "friend" or "unknown".  Our concept for the dedicated microwave QAF would result in a transponder not much larger than a hockey puck (not including antenna and prime power source)  Trade studies will address type of aerial platform sensor suite and QAF waveforms to determine optimum configuration considering ease of launch and recovery payload weight vs endurance confidence levels of QAF transponder returns and minimum cost of procurement.  New vs. existing sub-systems will be studied and compared.  Critical segments of the recommended "strawman" system will be modeled in preparation for subsequent demonstration in Phase II program. Forward area operational units (Company and below) will have SA capabilities never before available.  Low operational costs of early warning system will protect lives from both enemy and friendly fires.

Multi-mode payloads will be autonomously configured based on fusion of evidences provided by independent cooperative agents. This will require an advanced architecture to loosely couple distributed knowledge sources. The Adaptive Belief Engine will concurrently manage uncertain information from onboard processing agents as part of a Cluster Manager's intelligent reasoning. The same engine will concurrently support integrated Fault Management at the vehicle and/or cluster level. It will manage corroborate or refute evidences with varying degrees of certainty.  These evidences are dynamically gathered from various diagnostics and prognostics engines providing unparalleled confidence in spacecraft automation.  Results will be accumulated into the embedded shared database.  Significantly a cooperating expert system will evaluate rules dynamically uploaded that will trigger based on user-tunable thresholds of certainty associated with the current set of hypotheses.  The real-time executive will then concurrently process specified scripts to intelligently task the cluster payload and elements or even recover from newly detected faults.  This component will be integrated within a distributed blackboard architecture required to allow interchange of information across heterogeneous elements such as subsystems satellite clusters or other unmanned vehicles. -	Increase return in opportunistic acquisition of data (based on unanticipated events detected onboard) for military or science applications.  Sophisticated image or geo-location processing algorithms intrinsically generate uncertain data.  However combination of enough evidences provided by cooperating agents could result in opportunistic acquisition not previously anticipated.  Autonomous and continuous monitoring of wide areas becomes possible.  Stealth or silent mode of operations becomes the norm until specific data is downlinked.  This results in an effective data compression ratio that can reach 10000:1 as proven by the New Millennium Space Technology 6 program.    -	Increase effectiveness in delivering the right information at the right time to the right person (i.e. "direct to the shooters or the scientists").  -	Enhanced fault management allowing uncertainty within a set of cooperating diagnostics/prognostics engines working at the subsystem or system level and providing the means for autonomous recovery.  -	Decreased ground support cost due to a more effective onboard autonomous fault management recovery architecture that will communicate with the onboard planner and/or the model-based reasoner to reconfigure or re-plan as necessary.  This open architecture provides the necessary framework for inclusion of best-of-breed products to interoperate in a cooperative manner assuming that they handle uncertainty in a similar manner. This paves the way for more intelligent and capable systems in the field.  -	Significant software cost reduction by providing a freely available open-source component supported by a proven software vendor.           Potential Commercial Applications of the Research and Development    There is an increasing desire in many organizations including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) to use constellations or fleets of autonomous spacecraft working together to accomplish complex mission objectives.  The Afghan conflict saw the first unmanned vehicle with missile capability opening the way to Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) constellations already planned by the Air Force and the Navy.  The Office of Naval Research Future Naval Capabilities states:    "Let robots do the dangerous work. Naval forces can enhance their capabilities with technologies that increase the autonomy performance and affordability of their organic uninhabited vehicle systems. Autonomous systems will let Sailors and Marines disperse throughout the battlespace and still operate effectively influencing the action over great distances and long spans of time."     NASA's Space Launch Initiative has invested significant resources to perform risk reduction in key technology area deemed necessary to close the business case for the next-generation space vehicle.  One such technology area (TA-5) will address risks in developing an Integrated Vehicle Health Management system onboard the vehicle and on the Ground.    The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) National Security Agency (NSA) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) programs such as Counter Camouflage Concealment and Deception (Counter CC&D) Foliage Penetration (FOPEN) and UAV classified programs will also greatly benefit from this proposal work.  These capabilities usually require a multi-mode radar and need to be interfaced with other sensors.  Onboard processing and fusion of uncertain data is a key element.      The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has initiated the TechSat-21 program to serve as a proof of concept mission for a new paradigm for space missions.  This paradigm seeks to reduce costs and increase system robustness and maintainability by distributing functionality over several micro-satellites flying in formation.  Our involvement in this program gives us a unique opportunity to address both system/cluster level health management as well as radar payload data fusion in a flight configuration.","F021-0438","AF02-062","02.1",

The pointing mechanism would require high speed high precision angular actuators to maintain the relative angular position would be complex and costly. Recognizing the needs for satellite-UAV link as well as the conflicts in free space optical communication system design InterScience proposes to develop an Digital Micromirror Devices (DMD) based omnidirectional optical turret with very low PSR and multi-link capabilities for satellite-UAV and UAV-UAV interconnection applications.

The innovative omnidirectional optics makes multi-link connections possible and eliminates the gimbal's mechanical movements.  The DMD is used as Lyot stops to select passing beams to perform the point and track functionalities.  The unique combination of omnidirectional optics and the DMD provides a very small PSR value in selected directions.  The Phase I effort will focus on the optical design analysis and optimization of the omnidirectional optical system optical performance modeling of the DMD and a bench top demonstration of the afocal distortion free omnidirectional optics with DMD based anti-jam Lyot stops.

Intevac proposes to address these present limitations by adapting its miniature low power low-light level megapixel format VIS-NIR sensor and camera products for this small- and micro-UAV application.  The Intevac VIS-NIR low light level sensor is an Electron Bombarded Active Pixel Sensor (EBAPS).  EBAPS technology is based on use of a high quantum efficiency GaAs photocathode (derived from Generation-III image intensifier technology) in proximity focus with a high resolution backside thinned CMOS Active Pixel Sensor (APS) imager anode.  The EBAPS sensor does not utilize an optically opaque microchannel plate so it can be operated in a day-only mode with no high voltage applied to the sensor.

Based on our investigation however it appears that there is no ground truth for SIGACTS reports which prevents GMTI users program managers and researchers from performing apples-to-apples comparisons of information extraction technologies.  Given our close working relationship with GMTI analysts and experience with GMTI data in an ongoing project we propose to address this deficiency as part of this SBIR project. Another critical issue is the need to link information extracted from SIGACTS with other types of information used by analysts working with GMTI data.  We have been working closely with GMTI analysts at AF ESC CEIF to apply data analytics technologies to pattern discovery in GMTI data and are well positioned to link information extracted from SIGACTS reports to GMTI data.  This is another goal of this SBIR project. We also have recently developed a semi-supervised active learning method for information extraction that can be leveraged in existing systems for information extraction such as Intuidexâs IxEEEâ¢ or Janyaâs Semantexâ¢. A third goal of this SBIR project is thus to apply this rule learning technique to SIGACTS reports. Finallyit is also known that information extraction techniques can be supplemented with text classification techniques. In our work we have developed an approach to text classification that leverages recent advances in statistical relational learning.  The final thrust of this SBIR will be to apply our text classification algorithms to the problem of automatically categorizing events extracted from SIGACTS reports.  BENEFIT: The primary customers for SIGACT extraction products are forensic GMTI analysts at JIEDDO/COIC NASIC and NGA that will benefit from overlaying SIGACT information over GMTI data. There are also near-real-time analysts in the Army Marines and on board JSTARS and LSRS platforms.  Even though NRT analysts do not perform in-depth analysis of forensic data their ability to interpret NRT data will be enhanced by SIGACT data. According to our discussions analysts have a strong preference for new capabilities to be integrated into the products they currently use instead of developing new tools. Currently analysts use the MOVINT Client (MC) (developed by Northrop Grumman under funding from AFRL/Rome fusion lab) ISR Forensics (MITRE) display and Google Earth-based products. Army analysts are also using Common Ground Station (CGS). Most analysts are scheduled to transition to the new DCGS (Army or AF versions) that will include MC. In addition ground station for Army VADER UAV (developed by BAE Advanced Information Technologies) will also be based on MC. We are currently in discussions with the AFRL Fusion lab to develop an open API necessary to integrate external products such as the extraction products proposed herein into MC.","F083-055-1299","AF083-055","08.3",

Single crystals represent a revolutionary advance in piezoelectric actuator technology.  Because crystal electromechanical properties are significantly different than those of ceramic it should be expected that the use of crystals requires motion amplification techniques that are tailored to crystal behavior. This proposal describes a new high authority trailing edge flap actuator concept for helicopter rotor blade vibration control that has been specifically designed for single crystal stack actuators. Invercon has analytically and experimentally evaluated the feasibility of using single crystals together with a novel high-moment high-displacement buckling beam flap actuator concept which is well-suited for single crystal stack actuation. Experimental results show that the buckling beam actuator can dramatically outperform state-of-the-art flap actuators such as the X-frame with the capability of displacing a 36 “ flap ±5º at 40 Hz under representative aerodynamic loading at 400 RPM.  Such actuators also consist of less parts and are significantly lighter than existing designs.

The goal is to develop technologies and methods to rapidly configure and manage these networks so that they can share and disseminate critical data in realtime and to ensure that quality of service (QoS) measures are met.   In Phase I we have developed system management  methods for Mobile Backbone Network (MBN) based multi-tier ad hoc wireless networks.  In Phase II these techniques will be used for the development of system management (ISM) operation for systems that combine sensor networks MBN based communications networks and unmanned (airborne and ground based) vehicles.  We will define analyze simulate and test-bed demonstrate: Management Information Bases (MIBs) that will store the attributes of the underlying managed entities; Tasking & Management Interfaces (TMIs) that will allow management entities to monitor control and task the managed objects; Management application routines that calculate the best action to follow and methods to employ in allocating overall system resources.   Under a Phase II Option the integrated system management operation will be extended to incorporate multitasked UAV SWARM formations. Next generation highly mobile wireless systems combine the operation of sensor and communications networks.  These systems employ a dynamically configurable structure utilizing ground and airborne based unmanned vehicles (UAVs and UGVs). UAV SWARM formations will be configured using multi-tasked platforms that provide networking and sensing services to execute a multitude of missions.  We have proposed a scalable and manageable architecture that will provide for the implementation of such networks based on our recently developed mobile backbone network (MBN) concepts. Since the underlying mission and operational environment is continuously changing it is essential that a resource management system is employed to monitor control and manage the system and to allocate in realtime system resources. There are no current distributed software agents and integrated resource allocation tools that can operate in realtime for such networks. Our proposed architecture and methods for the implementation of such an Integrated System Management (ISM) operation will ensure that the system management operation reacts in realtime to changing mission requirements and to fluctuating system/environmental conditions.  Such intelligent models and software agents must be employed to connect the network monitoring functions with the system control mechanisms to ensure realtime adaptivity and a survivable operation.  The integrated system management structure and software to be developed is of key importance for ensuring a  responsive and survivable operation of ad hoc wireless networks homeland security systems C4ISR FORCEnet disaster relief networks industrial control systems geological and urban traffic control networked systems and any communications network system that integrates that sensing and telecommunications operations.","N2-0726","N02-T015","02  ",

We will develop new network state metrics that are continuously monitored and used to rapidly locate UVs in the right place at the right time to maximize network connectivity capacity and reliability offering a solution that is adaptively hierarchical and thus highly scalable.

A simple example would be to use the tool to deploy a mixed group of robots and humans to surround a designated area in an urban setting providing surveillance of its exit points.  Robots with infrared sensing capability might be deployed to monitor traffic through a tunnel area connecting two buildings robots carrying other specialized equipment might be sent to areas with a high probability of enemy fire some of the stealthier ones being directed to take the most covert path possible; and the human assets might be reserved away from the line of fire in an area where human interaction with noncombatants or human responsiveness might be crucial to the subtask at hand.

Griffon will combine the speed and range of a UAV with the precise ground mobility of a UGV.  Griffon will be based the rugged all-terrain iRobot PackBot UGV.  Griffon will add an Air Mobility System (AMS) to the PackBot consisting of a powered parafoil that attaches to the PackBot chassis.  The powered parafoil provides a compact lightweight means of adding flight capability to the PackBot.  Griffon will fly autonomously to operator-specified waypoints using an onboard GPS receiver and a three-axis orientation sensor.  Semi-autonomous launch and landing software will assist the operator in transitioning from ground to air modes and back.  During Phase I of this project we will develop a complete hardware and software design for Griffon.  The hardware design task will include the development of a radio-controlled powered parafoil demonstrator to determine the power and control requirements for the AMS.  The software design will include all of the Griffon software components and the system architecture for integrating these components.  During the Phase I Option we will integrate a gasoline-powered engine with a PackBot and develop the AMS engine control software.   UAVs provide an operator with the ability to rapidly arrive at a site of interest reconnoiter the area from above and (in the case of the armed Predator) deliver a lethal payload to any exposed target.  However UAVs lack the ability to observe or attack targets that are concealed inside structures such as caves or buildings.  In contrast UGVs have the capability to enter structures search for targets and examine these targets at close range (using video transmission).  However UGVs are much slower than UAVs have limited range and have less capability to cross very rough terrain.  In many situations what is needed is an unmanned vehicle that combines the strengths of UAVs and UGVs.    We propose to develop Griffon a man-portable UAV/UGV hybrid capable of performing reconnaissance surveillance and delivery of a lethal payload.  Griffon will be based on the iRobot Corporation PackBot platform a rugged all-weather all-terrain robot developed for DARPA's Tactical Mobile Robotics Program.  PackBot is currently being tested by the U.S. Army in Afghanistan on missions to search cave complexes and suspected al Qaeda compounds.  PackBot will be available as a commercial product in the fall of 2002.    The extensive use of airstrikes in Afghanistan has been successful at limiting U.S. casualties due to enemy action.  However the limitations of airpower are evident when intelligence about ground targets is incomplete or suspect both in terms of civilian casualties and the difficulty in precisely targeting enemy forces under concealment.  Weapons like Griffon will enable the Objective Force to strike accurately at enemies in caves buildings and other structures - hitting the desired targets minimizing collateral damage and providing real-time assessment of the attack's effectiveness.    Griffon will also have commercial applications in civilian search and rescue in rough terrain.  Griffon's flight capability will enable it to fly over lakes mountains and other potential obstacles to ground movement.  When Griffon finds a victim it will be able to land deliver medical aid and allow the victim to communicate with rescuers.  ","A022-0761","A02-011","02.2",

While laser diode bars with output power up to 80 W cw have been produced commercial 50 W and higher cw laser diode bars have not demonstrated good reliability or long lifetimes.  This is likely caused by the additional heat load and temperature rise suffered by these diode bars when mounted with conventional "copper block" techniques.  Clearly the limits of conventional diode bar mounting technology are being approached.    What is needed is a new packaging technology for high power laser diode bars.  Materials should be used that have higher thermal conductivity than copper and a coefficient of thermal expansion that is more closely matched to Gallium Arsenide.  In addition mechanical registration of the laser diode would reduce labor time for packaging further reducing unit cost.

KaZaK’s vehicle will be sized to carry and dispense multiple dropsondes to gather in-situ meteorological and oceanographic data over a widespread region in support of anti-submarine warfare (ASW) activities. KaZaK’s vehicle will greatly increase the ability of patrol aircraft to simultaneously track multiple targets located in various directions from the flight path and permit the P-3 MMA and other launch platforms to operate at a safe standoff distance from the littoral waters that have become a primary location for potential future ASW conflict. The envisioned system will be launch-compatible with existing and future ASW platforms and fit the A-size sonobuoy design envelope. The system will communicate via sonobuoy channels 1-99 for compatibility with current and future receivers. KaZaK will leverage our activities related to Navy and Air Force UAV development and work with technology leaders in multiple fields to produce a successful system. Our teaming approach will minimize cost and risk and allow rapid fielding of the envisioned enhanced dropsonde capability.  BENEFITS: At the conclusion of a successful Phase I and II the Navy will be in possession of a working flight tested system ready for Phase III activities involving more extensive testing and evaluation. The chief benefit of the proposed system will be a safer stand-off method of delivering multiple ASW sensors from Naval aircraft. Potential additional applications of the system extend into the commercial world in the areas of meteorological and oceanographic study. The system could prove very beneficial for obtaining data in areas which would normally pose an extreme danger to observation aircraft such as collection of weather data inside storms and hurricanes observation of conditions near active volcanoes and flights into areas that would pose a health risk to the crew of manned vehicles (for example near sites of accidental or intentional chemical nuclear or biological release). As an intentionally disposable system the vehicle could be sent on one-way missions along with its payload into areas that would be too risky to approach with more expensive reusable UAV systems.","N061-009-0619","N06-009","06.1",

These offboard organic vehicles (OOV) include air surface and undersea-unmanned vehicles. Current systems for onboard handling of these vehicles are labor intensive and require disparate pieces of equipment.   KCI working with Bath Iron Works proposes to design and build a new OOV handling system that provides for movement of OOVs from stowage to launch area and then automates returning it to stowage upon mission completion. The key to this system is a modular transporter system that is self-guiding and self-securing using vacuum technology. The transporter cart will be made from a combination of stainless steel and pultruded composite structural elements fabricated by KCI. We will draw heavily on experience gained in the design and fabrication of a similar multifunctional computer-vision vacuum secured system for the Air Force.

We will also develop test methods fabricate test specimens and perform experimental studies to validate the performance of key components of the handling system.    KCI's proposed solution for an OOV handling system makes use of an autonomous or semi-autonomous modular approach to ensure flexibility in meeting current and future OOV handling requirements at minimal cost minimal ship impact and significantly reduced program risk. The successful demonstration and acceptance of autonomous vehicles with the capabilities proposed for this Naval SBIR application are generically applicable to a wide range of future military and civilian applications. For example with the same guidance technology vehicles could be used to automate the delivery of critical supplies to troops operating in a hostile military environment. Commercial adaptations could be used to move warehoused items reducing manpower needs associated with shipping and handling.","N031-0935","N03-057","03.1",

After weapon release a tail-mounted parachute slows vertical descent such that wing deployment occurs at low airspeed and high altitude (i.e. low dynamic pressure). After the parachute cord is cut the ELW pitches up to achieve best L/D and glides to the target area providing significant standoff range (87 miles) and conserves fuel for loitering. Upon reaching loitering altitude for the LADAR seeker (300 to 750 ft AGL) the reciprocating engine is started and the search pattern is established. The weapon has 12 hour endurance at 67 mph and a 750 meter wide scanning footprint covering a 382 square mile area more than ten times greater than LOCAAS (which has only 30 minute endurance).    Key to this performance is an extremely lightweight and aerodynamically efficient deployable structure using low cost pultruded composites for deployable wing spars. The fundamental technology for the deployable spar has been used on numerous deployable spacecraft booms and can be readily adapted to Loitering Weapon requirements using novel methods such as Shape Memory Alloy locking elements.    Upon completion of Phase I a detailed weapon aerodynamic and structural design and analysis will be generated. A full-scale wing deployable spar shall be fabricated. This structure will be used to demonstrate multiple deployment and retraction cycles to verify the robustness and reliability of the deployable structure. It shall then be proof loaded to assure that the structure has adequate safety margins for all flight conditions. Many military systems use deployable wing structures based on inflatable fabrics and rigid hinged structures. The proposed concept once proven would provide designers with another viable approach to developing a large wing from a small package. Markets could include easily transportable UAVs and long-range weapons. Sizes could be scaled down for man-portable "personal reconnaissance vehicles" or scaled up for large long duration sensors platforms. The coiled boom technology used for the wing spars might be developed into non-flight applications without the wing skins. Uses could include portable masts and antenna towers as well as instantly-installable and removable temporary structures for advertising at trade show. The multi-element concept might actually improve the performance of the booms in space applications as well.","F031-1628","AF03-133","03.1",

The main motivation of this proposed effort is reducing the SPL’s of the radiated tones of UAV’s since stealth is critical to the success of their operation. In the present design of most UAV’s the propeller is rear mounted and thus operates in a push rather than a pull mode that is common in say turboprop engines. With the push-type propeller noise is generated by rotor interaction with the time invariant flow distortions that are generated due to the presence of the upstream components of aircraft e.g. the fuselage. Since this is an inherent feature of the design the only recourse to reducing the radiation noise is to attenuate it either actively or passively. In Phase I KCF will demonstrate the technical feasibility of the quasi-active noise control method for UAVs without significant impact to UAV performance and develop a detailed analysis of predicted performance of the proposed technology.

There has been a rapid increase in the use of small unmanned aircraft systems (SUAS) for military and commercial uses. This sudden demand has created a technology gap for small propellers. Radio-controlled (RC) propellers with basic airfoil sections and design practices are not optimized for the flight regime and mission of SUAS. These offer mediocre performance and high acoustic signatures due to the higher revolutions per minute (RPM) levels associated with internal combustion engines (ICE) thus allowing enemy forces to easily detect the presence of SUASs. With the recent push towards electric motors and quieter ICE technologies there is a need for quieter propeller designs for military and commercial operations. This proposal aims to facilitate the development of innovative propeller designs for SUAS with less than 50 hp. The proposed solution will exploit the use of advanced parametric modeling noise prediction algorithms and evolutionary airfoil sections to yield quieter propeller designs. This methodical approach combined with real experience designing and testing propellers and SUAS flight vehicles will result in achievement of the program’s acoustic and performance goals and thus improved SUAS mission endurance and survivability.   BENEFIT:  Commercialization of efficient and quiet propeller design technologies include licensing to numerous existing and future SUAS contractors. There are a number of contractors developing high endurance ISR-focused SUASs for AFSOC USSOCOM and the AFRL’s Tube-Launched Expendable UAS (TLEU) program that require stealthy operation and need quiet propellers. Also the Navy’s Small Tier II UAS and the Army’s next version of Shadow (RQ-7C) will benefit from efficient and quiet propeller technologies.

The resulting integrated GPS/IMU system would offer significant performance (e.g. reduced accuracy degradation) and cost benefits. By tightly coupling the GPS pseudorange and inertial sensor measurements within a single navigation filter the inertial and GPS components cooperate on a much higher level providing a more robust and accurate navigation system. Additional robust satellite tracking can be provided via adaptive techniques in the antenna portion of the GPS receiver. KVH seeks to integrate raw inertial sensor measurements and GPS receiver code phase measurements directly within a single navigation filter. The advantages of this "ultra-tightly coupled system" include increased accuracy of the navigation solution decreased complexity and cost of the navigation subsystem improved robustness in an RF-challenged environment and reduction in the size of the GPS/IMU navigator. We envision an ultra-tightly coupled system housed within a single cylindrical package that would include three rate sensors three acceleration sensors a GPS receiver power conditioning and a single navigation filter.  Potential commercial application for the ultra-tightly coupled high anti-jam GPS/INS system include: integrated hybrid navigation and flight control systems for precision guided munitions and missiles; loitering weapons; stabilization and aiming of airborne pods for laser designation and aerial reconnaissance; airborne drones targets decoys; aircraft attitude and heading reference systems; a variety of Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAV); navigation and pointing applications for combat vehicles COMINT SIGINT ELINT; combat service support; combat support vehicles; non-military land navigation tracking and reporting systems; tracking of hazardous materials; fire and rescue services police and even the general public.

The ability to task or mode interleave with adaptive scheduling is essential to achieving desired sensor/mission effectiveness. Both active electronically scanned array (AESA) and conventional mechanically scanned antenna (MSA) airborne multi-mode radar systems will require energy timeline resource management to realize their full performance capabilities. Real-time adaptive optimization of AESA control and scheduling over the implicitly large number of degrees of freedom is computationally impractical without sufficient constraints. In contrast non-adaptive legacy resource management approaches rely exclusively on rule-based constrained methodologies that relax computational concerns but significantly under utilize radar energy timeline resources. LSI proposes to extend the work currently being performed under our N06-123 effort that is building a modular framework to develop and evaluate sensor resource management (RM) concepts. We will also leverage the results of our recently completed N05-006 effort entitled “Radar Detection and Discrimination of Small Maritime Targets at High Altitude and Grazing Angle that examined simultaneous multi-target tracking and discrimination (MTT&D) through the inclusion of target features within an interactive multiple model/multiple hypothesis tracking (IMM/MHT) framework [1]. The connection between the RM and MTT&D lies in the desire to adaptively control sensor revisit and dwell time as needed to maintain desired track quality and target discrimination. LSI will incorporate a MTT&D functional understanding and the associated performance attributes in the RM through the use of metadata. The overall proposed effort to develop and evaluate hybrid rule-based constrained optimization techniques for real-time adaptive optimization of airborne AESA and MSA control/scheduling involves many technical areas that are applicable to specific USN AESA radar sensors planned for the BAMS and VT-UAV platforms.","N2-3110","N06-123","06.2",

The current state of the art in predicting on-aircraft RF performance and performance degradation from EMI (also known as co-site interference) utilizes physics-based modeling and simulation tools that consider a static or stationary environment. However real world environments are dynamically changing on scales that lead to unpredicted system performance degradation that are a direct result of non-stationary conditions. The request for proposal (RFP) indicates that on-aircraft effects from blade (or other moving part) modulation are among the sources of interference that need to be quantified with respect to their impact on antenna pattern degradation and associated system performance degradation. However on-aircraft EMI conditions can vary significantly depending on antenna location on the platform and whether they mechanically and/or electronically rotate to perform their function. Another consideration is the inclusion intentional or unintentional off-board RF interference that can interact with the platform/sensor dynamics in ways that can vary with illumination geometry and platform trajectories. Scenarios that combine these conditions further complicate the co-site interference between on-board systems that must simultaneously operate. This SBIR effort will identify and categorize classes of EMI along with potential solutions that will include passive active and hybrid passive-active techniques. In addition a subset of these potential solutions will be identified for possible implementation within an adaptive sensor resource manager (RM) framework. Finally modeling methods will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a select subset of EMI mitigation techniques that are of relative near term value to EA-18G SH-60R and the MQ-8B Fire Scout VTUAV operating scenarios.","N103-202-0066","N103-202","10.3",

The majority of contemporary ladar systems utilize high pulse repetition frequency (PRF) compact diode end-pumped solid-state lasers as transmitter sources. Examples of systems currently under development that use this type of laser are LOCASS DAZZLE and CMRTR among others. In order for these systems to reach their full military utility they must be very compact lightweight rugged efficient low cost and easily mass-produced. One key factor in achieving this level of maturity is the integration of advanced conduction-cooling subsystems to the laser. The work performed under this program addresses the shortcomings of current laser and laser cooling technology and provides an innovative approach to meeting the goals of contemporary advanced ladar seeker programs.  The product of our Phase-II development will be a fully qualified and packaged ladar transmitter that utilizes advanced active and passive cooling to fulfill the mission requirements of both continuous and intermittent operation respectively. The laser system under this program will be tested against the shock vibration and temperature environment of a contemporary missile platform.  The laser system technology and demonstration will have direct application in present and planned ladar seeker programs. The laser performance and reliability against harsh environmental conditions is considered to be among the highest risk items of the ladar seeker system. Therefore successful environmental testing of the laser transmitter will help reduce the risk for on-going and future advanced ladar seeker programs.  Three-dimensional laser radar is widely accepted as a preferred alternative to stereography as a means of producing digital elevation maps of the Earth's surface. Imaging laser altimeter (ILA) systems utilize the same technology as is employed in contemporary ladar seekers. Lite Cycles Inc. is currently pursuing ILA as a commercial application of the technology developed under this SBIR program.  Lite Cycles Inc. has identified and targeted two significant markets applicable for relatively high volume production:  (1) "Seeker" type missile systems and (2) 3-D imaging laser altimetry (ILA) for military and commercial markets.  In addition the cooling technology also lends itself to compact laser designators required for tomorrow's Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).      Seeker applications include (1) loiter attack missile (LAM) ladar seekers and (2) cruise missile real time re-targeting (CMRTR) ladar seekers.  The compact/advanced cooling laser transmitter developed in this program can be integrated into both ladar systems.      ILA applications include topographic mapping disaster prevention urban planning and development infrastructure construction maintenance and management agriculture and forestry overhead transmission line survey etc.  Additionally there are military applications for early battlefield assessment and continuous terrain update. The technology advancements developed in Phases I and II can be applied directly to offer a cost-effective reliable and user friendly compact ILA system.  ","A2-0925","A02-154","02.2",

Moderate range ship-to-ship communications can use free space optics (FSO) to take advantage of the unregulated infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to minimize or eliminate RF emissions.  We propose to investigate the feasibility of developing a Free Space Optics (FSO) Ship to Ship Network Communication system that can be used to form a nominally 50 km range variable data rate non line-of-sight connection to facilitate secure and interference free communications between moving ships. The FSO system is based on a novel building-block transceiver implementation to integrate all of the necessary features into a small rugged package suitable for ship and small UAV installation.  As envisioned the system would provide: ship-to-ship line-of-slight (LOS) communications ship to aircraft and ashore communications (Non-LOS) accommodate a variable-speed data rate to operate reliably in all kinds of weather (from 100 Mbps to 64Kbps) and operate in the eye-safe 1550nm wavelength region of the spectrum.  Relevant near-term applications are present in both military and commercial markets. They include: High bandwidth data communications between ships and from ship to shore Mine and buoy status communications Data communications and relay links between aircraft and automobiles Underwater harbor surveillance and communication system Voice and data communications for divers and undersea rescue workers Remote ocean measurement and monitoring capability Wideband metropolitan area networks Airport emergency crews (FAA) Federal surveillance efforts including multichannel (CIA NSA DISA) Law and drug enforcement surveillance relay system (DEA BATF FBI) Battlefield or other mobile military communications special operations (DoD).","N022-1169","N02-126","02.2",

Dielectric nanocomposites are hybrid systems that offer the potential to meet the next energy storage requirements by combining the high k performance of ceramics with the high breakdown strength and low loss of polymers.  Currently dielectric nanocomposites are prepared by combining high k nanoparticles into polymer matrices.  To achieve a high dielectric constant high filler volumes (>50%) are needed.  As the loading increases the film quality mechanical properties thermal stress reliability and dielectric breakdown strength have all been shown to degrade.  To overcome these problems Luna proposes to develop a dielectric polymer nanocomposite system based on unique functionalized nanomaterials that are well dispersed in a polymer matrix.  The goal of the program is to prepare a dielectric nanocomposite containing a low percentage of nanofillers that demonstrates good electrical performance.  In the Phase I program Luna will evaluate several nanofiller materials and their dispersion with appropriate polymer systems.  Once suitable polymer/nanofiller combinations are identified nanocomposite fabrication methods will be developed.  Finally the electrical properties will be demonstrated.    BENEFIT:   The materials developed in this Phase I program would find use as capacitor components for pulsed power applications.  Pulsed power capacitors with improved electrical performance would have use in power systems for directed energy weapons.  In addition the proposed technology would find application in military markets that demand large pulsed power capacitor banks such as integrated power units on unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) military shelter power applications and electromagnetic rail launchers.

They have high power demands and need small lightweight high energy density power supplies.  One way to achieve the needed power and energy density is through the use of multifunctional structures.  In Phase I of this project we demonstrated that a monopolar proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell could be fabricated into a multifunctional structure that is not only a lightweight power supply (with an output of 1 W/g 100 mW/cm2) for the MAV but also serves as the skin of the wings and a communication antenna.

Current lithium-ion batteries utilize flammable organic solvent-based electrolytes which result in safety hazards particularly during abuse/overcharge conditions. In addition current lithium-ion batteries have relatively low energy densities due to the limited charge storage capacity of current anodes and cathodes.  Lynntech is currently developing advanced solid-state lithium batteries based on a highly conductive solid inorganic electrolyte and advanced high capacity electrodes. The highly conductive solid electrolyte can provide solid-state batteries with significantly improved safety/abuse tolerance compared with current Li-ion batteries.  The development of high capacity electrodes can provide solid-state batteries with improved energy densities compared with current Li-ion batteries.   During the Phase II project Lynntech will optimize battery fabrication and performance and determine the cycle life energy and power density temperature capabilities and safety/abuse tolerance of prototype solid-state lithium batteries. The Phase II project will also develop designs and processes to produce scaled-up solid-state lithium batteries. The advanced solid-state batteries can provide improved safety/abuse tolerance high energy density energy storage/delivery systems for a variety of Air Force/DoD platforms including UAVs soldier power and other applications.  BENEFIT:  The proposed solid-state lithium batteries can provide improved rechargeable batteries for numerous Air Force/DoD platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) soldier power aircraft power munitions and other applications.  The specific advantages of the solid-state batteries are improved safety/abuse tolerance high energy density and improved temperature capabilities. Specific benefits for DoD include improved safety extended duration missions reduced carry weight for soldiers and reduced costs.

Small UAVs used for surveillance of battlespace must be capable of long duration flights while providing the necessary data to aid military personnel.  Current battery technologies have limited energy densities and provide small UAVs with ~1-2 hours of operational time which significantly limits their capabilities.  The Air Force is currently interested in operating small UAVs for 4-10 hours or longer depending on the type of mission.  To extend the flight time of small UAVs Lynntech proposes to develop an advanced high energy density battery based on a unique vanadium boride (VB2) anode and an air cathode.  Lynntech’s VB2/air battery utilizes a multiple electron electrochemical energy storage process which results in a battery with several fold higher energy density than existing batteries.  The Phase I project will fabricate and test small scale VB2/air cells and determine projected metrics for full scale cells to demonstrate the ability to provide long endurance UAVs compared with those utilizing current batteries. During the Phase II Lynntech will develop and test full scale cells for long endurance UAVs.

Because onboard space on RPVs is limited miniaturized power supplies which can deliver high energy densities in scalable quantities are needed to power instrumentation and flight termination systems.  RPVs face extreme temperatures and power supplies must be capable of safe and reliable operation at high and low temperature regimes.  Lynntech proposes to develop a miniaturized smart rechargeable non-flammable Lithium-ion battery that will safely and reliably operate in the temperature range of -40 to +85 °C and will be capable of generating 30 Wh of energy with scalable charge capacities (1 – 10 Ah). In order to accomplish this Lynntech will develop a highly conductive wide temperature range electrolyte/solvent mixture during the Phase I project. A prototype based on the advanced electrolyte and high capacity electrodes will be fabricated and the performance demonstrated under varying loads of 0.25C to 2C.  Phase II will focus on refining the prototype to meet military requirements (i.e. 30 Wh <4 in3 military-grade parts and smart software) and field testing.  BENEFIT:  Miniaturized rechargeable Lithium-ion batteries that deliver high energy densities in high and low temperature regimes would satisfy the U.S. Air Force’s need for small power supplies for Remotely Piloted Vehicles particularly the Raven and Dakota.  The benefits of developed Li-ion batteries to the Air Force and other DoD agencies include improved stability and reliability at extreme temperatures increased safety and high performance during critical operations.  The developed electrolytes for wide temperature ranges will also benefit the private sector. Li-ion batteries based on advanced electrolytes designed for commercial products (e.g. consumer electronic devices and hybrid/electric vehicles) can have improved power densities reliable operation in various climates and reduced risks of explosions.

To reach more substantial fuel savings will require better (higher zT) thermoelectric materials and tighter integration of the engine thermoelectric stack power conditioning unit and thermal bus. In this Phase I MEC proposes the further development of a landmark high-zT thermoelectric material recently developed for UAV waste heat recovery. MEC’s thermoelectric material uses nanostructures to induce phonon confinement and thereby improve the ratio of electrical to thermal conductivity. MEC is also in the process of developing a high-efficiency purpose-built 60-hp three-cylinder turbodiesel engine for an Army APU application. The proposed thermoelectric waste-heat recovery system will build off of that engine platform to push the system efficiency considerably beyond the current state-of-the-art for military generators.

The Air Force currently seeks a TES with system-based heat capacities of 68 kJ/kg and 120 MJ/m3 while allowing for a charge/discharge rate of 2 kW/kg.  Currently state-of-the-art paraffin- metal-hydride- and ammonia-based reversible systems have volume based system heat capacities that do not exceed 90 MJ/m3.  Mainstream¡¦s approach which combines both latent- and bond-reaction thermal storage is capable of >450 MJ/m3 by employing an open-loop concept that allows for recharging during ground-operations.  This approach can easily be tailored for either HPM 70 „aC or HEL 20 „aC DEW.  For the Phase I effort Mainstream will experimentally demonstrate the heat capacity and heat input rate.  The Phase II effort will focus on the integration of the TES with an avionic TMS.  BENEFIT:  Solid-state lasers for direct energy weapons (DEW) require a minimum capacity of 100 kW of optical power.  However existing efficiencies of the DEW are <10% yielding a thermal load of >1 MW.  However DEWs are also characterized by low duty cycles allowing for thermal energy storage (TES) to significantly reduce the size of the thermal management system (TMS).  Even if a reversible system could be designed to yield 120 MJ/m3 (current state of the art is < 90 MJ/m3) the TES would require 12.6 m3 (assuming ATLS mission profile).

The DE payload will include laser target identification and designation.  The vehicle will be launched using a pneumatic launcher and recovered via a parachute.  This system will employ advanced autopilot and navigation systems to be simple enough for a non-pilot operator to control.  It will be capable of having vehicle and payload control transferred to a forward operating team.   It will use commercial-off-the-shelf electronic components to minimize the systems cost and ensure seamless integration into existing networks.  The systems production cost will be $50000 or less.  The system is designed to be as logistically simple as small-class UASs; however it will have capabilities that current tactical-class UASs do not have.  BENEFIT: The purpose of this engineering development is to produce a tactical-class UAS available at a cost of $50000 or less.  This vehicle will have an intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) mission with a 24 hour maximum endurance.  This system will have a directed energy (DE) payload capable of laser target identification and designation.  In addition to being inexpensive non-pilot operators will be capable of using this system with minimal training.  This system will then be used to operate existing and flight test future military and civilian payloads due to its flexible plug and play design. On the battlefield this system will offer combat commanders (COCOMs) significant mission capability including persistent ISR precision target location and designation base protection battle damage assessment and battle management.  This system is capable of being launched from safe zones and flying behind enemy lines to allow forward operating troops to control the vehicle to have real-time intelligence and precision targeting capabilities.  This system will provide the military additional capabilities allowing the military to become more efficient and effective while reducing the risk of casualties.  The US Border Patrol US Coast Guard and US Forest Service could use this system for day and night operations to reduce the cost and risk of flying manned platforms.  This system can perform border and coastal surveillance aid in search and rescue missions and fly over dangerous wildfires without endangering people or risking expensive assets. The system design and technology integration will offer the DoD and commercial organizations the capability of theater-class UASs with the simple logistics and cost of small-class UASs.","F083-006-2450","AF083-006","08.3",

The requirement applies to both fixed and rotary wing aircraft each with its own aerodynamic limitations to carry appropriate sensor systems.  Suggestions are presented for interchangeable (easy-on easy-off) B kit antennas which cover a limited band of frequencies and which may be installed for a particular intelligence gathering mission or several UAVs may be launched with each one configured to cover a different frequency band.Typically antenna solutions for aircraft are designed as an afterthought after the airframe has been completed. While this approach will always impact the performance of larger aircraft to some extent in the case of smaller airframe UAV's the addition of discrete "add-on" antennas can add significant flight performance risk due to deleterious alterations to its aerodynamic properties.  It is the purpose of this proposal to introduce a new approach to antenna/sensor design; namely the utilization of the existing aircraft surfaces wings and blades as antenna structures.  This concept is made possible through the utilization of microstrip patch elements [1] and microstrip reflectarrays [2].   The microstrip patch antenna is utilized for low frequency applications (i.e. < 5 GHz)  while the microstrip reflectarray is optimum for frequencies greater than 5 GHz.The principal benefits of the proposed program are the proof of concept of simple applique type antenna systems which can be installed on a wide variety of military and commercial aircraft. This technology provides opportunities for the inclusion of advanced antenna technology on a much less invasive basis than conventional discrete antenna techniques. Such appliques may be integrated as portions of the fundamental airframe design or they may be added to existing airframes with minimal aerodynamic performance impact.","A002-2071","A00-136","00.2",

We propose to associate the scatterer positions in the two views by analyzing distortions of a topview as the imaging interval is shifted slightly in time.  The measurements will be based on Complex-Image Analysis a radar resolution theory and processing technology appropriate for highly resolved man-made targets which achieves the inherent resolution capability of radar. With Complex-Image Analysis the positions of major scatterers persist over large changes in target orientation so require only a small comparison database which is easily obtained.  The extracted positions are robust against contamination by interfering signals insensitive to changes in configuration and allow classification of previously unknown targets.

MaXentrics millimeter wave electronics focus on a new and promising architecture called meta-material in a tiled or tray active array amplifier. Our approach borrows heavily from previously advanced quasi-optics concepts which recognized and exploited the inherent advantages of free-space power combining as compared to traditional planar power combining methods. Intrinsically three-dimensional the tiled or tray active array amplifier relies on tunable TEM waveguide structures enabled by engineered two and three dimensional metal-dielectric structures configured at meta-materials.  BENEFIT:  For unmanned systems video data constitutes the only “eyes-in-the-sky” and thus the only link that a ground crew may have with what is actually going on in the vicinity of an unmanned air vehicle.  A ground crew hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away the video data link becomes absolutely critical to the safety and success of the mission. The W-Band Transmitter will solve these problems and meet the market needs. The W-Band transmitter is uniquely suited for higher bandwidth communication for multi-senor video streams and more complex command and controls.The 2012 budget for UAV predator and reaper modifications is approximately $325 million and from $475 million to $550 million for each remaining year of this decade.  It is anticipated that a portion of these budgeted funds will be for SATCOM communication with the new WGS satellites thus incorporating new W-Band transmitter into preexisting UAVs.","F121-046-0398","AF121-046","12.1",

MaXentric will employ a noise cancellation design in AlGaN/GaN low noise amplifiers (LNA) to reduce the overall noise in conjunction with optimal gate biasing and digital predistortion to enhance the overall linearity. The technology will yield low noise amplifier’s noise figure of less than 1.5dB with 100MHz bandwidth at all powers and all receiving bands (X-band and Ka band). A tunable network provides adaptive inter-stage matching to improve the frequency agility and the linearity.  BENEFIT:  The X-band and Ka-band LNAs proposed by MaXentric have unprecedented interference tolerance and distortion mitigation. For Air Force applications the LNAs could be used on jammer aircraft. Harmonic and spurious emissions from jammers can be relatively large and using these X-band and Ka-band LNAs may allow the aircraft to continue to communicate even when the jammers are active. The crowded conditions on decks of Navy aircraft carriers can also lead to large interfering signals so these LNAs would be desirable for topside applications.  Air Force UAVs often feature various communication pod payloads and sometimes substitute for satellite communication relays due to their long endurance times. The communication pods may become targets for hostile jammers and even friendly miss-pointing of other antennas. Using our proposed LNAs on the pods will allow for minimum noise figure maximum interference tolerance and minimum distortion. In civilian applications X-band and Ka-band radars are sometimes used to map the earth’s crust for earthquake activity and plate tectonics. The low noise figure and high interference tolerance of the LNA will allow for the use of lower mass diplexers with improved topological resolution. NASA also uses X-band and Ka-band for deep space communication so the LNA can be used adjacent to low mass high power amplifiers with improved link margin. The LNAs will allow for improved link margins with and reduced filtering requirements.   ","F103-178-0797","AF103-178","10.3",

Projections based upon lab scale tests show that a 20% reduction in volume and a 33% increase in flight time can be achieved with this new system.

Military navigation systems for air and sea vehicles require reliable GPS performance and the use of Iridium signals to provide an alternate robust worldwide navigation and communications capability. Some type of jamming signal mitigation technique is needed beyond conventional filter methods since these interference signals are in the GPS/Iridium bands and therefore cannot be removed with traditional in-band filtering. Consequently a cancellation method that preserves the GPS/Iridium signals while eliminating the undesired interference is needed. Antenna nulling methods are a common solution for mitigating jammer signals from GPS however many existing air and sea vehicles have limited space and power requirements that do not allow for traditional antenna nulling/beam-steering anti-jam solutions that require large antenna arrays and antenna electronics of considerable power and size. Mayflower proposes to leverage its SAS AJ technology with added Iridium capabilities and integrate the antenna nulling electronics into a 4-inch diameter multi-element array with Iridium support. The proposed Mayflower iGAAS system will be a common solution for air and sea vehicles that will provide simultaneous GPS reception and Iridium transmit/receive capability as well as simultaneous nulling protection of the GPS and Iridium bands.","N122-115-0122","N122-115","12.2",

The Phase II task consists of a base program wherein the Phase I ground-test design is developed into an efficient light-weight flight configuration and two follow-on funding options.  Option 1 consists of: additional engine testing against PFR requirements of the Joint UAV Program Office (JPO) for HFE upgrade of the short-range UAV program; optimization of the gas generator for further improve SFC; and procurement of two propellers.  Option 2 consists of:  incorporation of a mission-tailored exhaust system; design and development of an engine mounted starter and design and development of an inlet particle separator. This gas turbine engine can be used to power remotely-piloted UAVs replacing existing piston engines thus eliminating the requirement for gasoline on the battlefield.  This engine would have application on the TRW/IAI Short-Range Hunter UAV and would provide a basis for a family of affordable general aviation engines that burn heavy fuel.

Undersea thermal vents create opportunities to generate significant levels of at-sea power. Effectively harnessed benefits derived from subsea power sources range from increased station-keeping to persistent surveillance. Mechanical Solutions Inc. (MSI) proposes an approach that will result in compact and durable closed Rankine cycle systems that provide electric power in deep sea environments. A single high-speed rotating machine with oil-free process lubricated bearings in a hermetically sealed package forms the heart of a system that will be durable lightweight and small in size. Successful development of the MSI technology will help meet the ever-growing demand for more electric power in subsea environments. The MSI system will be maintenance-free easy to deploy with simple yet practical means to negate the fouling effects typically encountered in hydrothermal vents.  Phase II will provide a prototype of a practical and cost-effective thermal-to-electric power conversion system. MSI’s Phase I pre-proposal analysis work included assessment of a sample cycle using a standard power fluid with good results.

Susceptibility is typically examined using computer modeling techniques where an infrared (IR) model of the aircraft is generated and a missile is digitally flown toward the aircraft to determine if it hits or misses. To increase the accuracy of these models large amounts of data on actual free-flight missile miss-distance is required to model missile performance distributions that more closely match reality. This will allow susceptibility models to be validated providing better data for the warfighter and developers of countermeasures. To facilitate data acquisition at live fire missile tests a Portable Missile Miss-Distance Identification System (PMMDIS) is proposed. The PMMDIS will automatically determine missile miss-distances within +/-3 inches for missiles missing their targets by as much as 60 ft. In addition to the high level of accuracy the system will be portable easy to set up light weight permit remote operation and post processing of missile test data and perform for daytime and nighttime missile tests.  The system will also require minimal user interaction provide sufficient power to operate for 15 days of continuous uninterrupted recording and perform auto-calibration if a camera is moved during the test.   BENEFIT:  At the conclusion of the proposed Phase II project MSI will deliver a Portable Missile Miss-Distance Identification System (PMMDIS) to the 46th TG/OL-AC – Aerospace Survivability & Safety Operating Location that can be used at several different ranges. The initial PMMDIS system is modular in design so that it forms a foundation for a product family so that MSI and its current and future partners can pursue alternative military and commercial applications. While the initial efforts for PMMDIS development will focus on creating a product that meets the Air Force’s unique needs for assessing MANPADS missile miss-distances during free-flight launch tests the system will have adaptation potential to a number of other military and commercial uses.  There are three paths for pursing additional applications by leveraging the Phase II project results. The first path requires relatively minor PMMDIS system modifications to meet requirements for measuring missile orientation as it leaves the launch tube and for measuring the lethality effectiveness of guided and unguided bombs. The second longer term path focuses on applications such as a UAV-based lethality battle damage analysis system and a system that provides warning and activation of Infrared Counter Measures (IRCM) for both military and commercial aircraft. The third path includes commercial applications such as stereo vision and imaging products for tracking golf balls baseballs and video graphics. The disruptive technology for all three paths is providing highly accurate measurements using a relatively low cost camera based sensor (and advanced processing software) when compared to more expensive radar or laser measurement systems.  A further adaptation of PMMDIS can be made to evaluate the lethality effectiveness of other weapon systems such as guided and unguided bombs. Large bombing ranges such as 46th Test Wing’s ranges at Eglin AFB want a low-cost system to rapidly assess bombing accuracy. The adaption can be accomplished with reduced funding levels due to leveraging the technology developed in the PMMDIS program. The same system can be used for air-to-ground missile launches in lethality evaluations. It can also be used to assess missile accuracy for launches at target drones. Perhaps the most notable military or commercial derivation of PMMDIS involves the fielding of this system on aircraft to provide warning and activation of IRCM protection measures. A key advantage of MSI’s highly accurate system is the relatively low cost of the camera-based system versus methods that rely on higher cost radars or lasers. Approximately 80% of U.S. fixed-wing aircraft losses in Desert Storm were from ground based Iraqi defensive systems using IR SAMS. Both IR SAMS and IR air-to-air missiles have seekers with improved Counter-Countermeasures (CCM) capabilities that seriously degrade the effectiveness of current expendable decoys. By one estimate more than 500000 shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles exist and are available on the worldwide market. MSI has already designed such a system for RPG protection in ground vehicles using a variant of the PMMDIS as the sensor. The PMMDIS developments will be further examined for updating current missile warning systems on aircraft. The potential for a low-cost on-aircraft system that may be provided by PMMDIS will be extremely valuable with very competitive pay back time periods compared to other options. Other non-military or non-terrorist applications of the PMMDIS have also been conceived. The system has the potential to update previous work performed in the area of stereo vision and image processing for tracking golf balls or even baseballs for television graphics. It can also be used for indoor training aids for golf baseball pitching/hitting football passing/kicking or other sports where trajectory orientation and velocity are important to track and project outward. For example current systems for baseball strike zone monitoring provided by Questec use a 4 camera system. Major League Baseball Advanced Media and Sports Vision are releasing a more modern and more expensive system called Zone Evaluation that utilizes 12 cameras. Based on MSI’s initial evaluation a variation of PMMDIS can provide the accuracy of the Zone Evaluation at a sell price comparable to the traditional Questec system. The MSI variant that is technically an equivalent to the Questec system will cost about two-thirds less than the current Questec system. This will make the system more affordable for college and minor league parks leading to a potential tenfold increase in market size.","F2-5668","AF083-254","08.3",

An innovative approach based on novel loaded broadband elements that have uniform VSWR and E-plane patterns over multiple octaves is used. Other benefits of the proposed approach are: reduced mutual coupling between the elements so that the performance is improved at the lower operating frequencies compared with a conventional array of the same baseline; minimization of the number of sub-arrays required to cover the bandwidth; reduced dependency on a good electrical ground; and reduced coupling to the airframe.  Non-planar mounting of the elements on the platform can be compensated for in the individual element loading to equalize their phase centers.  The approach takes into account the need for two or more baselines to cover the required band and a detailed analysis for siting the sub-arrays to optimize performance using computer models of the platform.

Using an optimal model of task performance subject to human constraints may be a more efficient way to develop models of skilled human performance for use in training especially since optimal models are simpler to validate test and debug than corresponding expert models.  In addition constrained optimal models can be constructed in domains where no experts are available or even exist.  Using a simulated task environment (STE) permits the necessary close model-trainee interaction by enabling the construction of optimal performance models and by allowing them to perform the same task as the trainee using the same interface while closely observing and guiding trainee performance.

A similar system has   already been patented by Midé Technology: the Piezoelectric Ignition and Sensing   Device (PISD) was successfully integrated into an engine proving feasibility of   the concept. (Video footage is available on request).  Piezoelectric ignition and   sensing has been demonstrated on a Honda ES6500 generator engine using conventional   polycrystalline piezoceramics.  While these common piezos produce high voltages the   energy they supply is very small (1 mJ).  Single-crystal piezos offer a significant   energy density improvement over their polycrystalline counterparts.  A piezoelectric   ignition system utilizing single crystal piezos would not require an external energy   source such as the high current capacitors in the present PISD configuration.    Eliminating the electrical leads for this current leaves a Wireless Ignition System   Utilizing Piezoelectrics (WISEUP) with the capability of generating timing and   delivering a spark in all feasible operating conditions.  This wireless technology   can only be enabled by the implementation of single crystal elements into a   piezoelectric ignition system.Spark plug wires are being made obsolete for the same reasons that distributors were   eliminated: vehicle manufacturers want to increase ignition reliability and   performance and want to reduce manufacturing costs.  Spark plug wires have the   numerous deficiencies.  Some of those include the heavy insulation is required to   insulate the 10 - 40 kV of electric potential resistance in the wires reduces the   energy that is delivered to the spark plug and is the weak link in the ignition   system (often the reason for misfires) and more insulation is needed to suppress   the EMI resulting from the high voltage in the long wires (antennas).  Common applications may be both military and commercial such as wireless ignition   systems for UAV's (reduced EMI improves payload performance) spark-assisted diesel   engines power generators and standard automotive systems.

The symmetric underwater shapes will minimize drag and depth control requirements while the non-symmetric surface shapes will allow the submersible to operate at high speed and low drag on the surface.The primary focus of Phase I will be the morphing of the hull structure while considering the need to house/contain a suite of sensors in the hull structure.  CFD codes and structural finite element codes will be used to determine the amount of morphing that can be achieved and the performance that it will provide.  In Phase II prototypes will be built to demonstrate the feasibility of the innovation. The most significant benefits are increase in range reduced fuel consumption and stealth.

Copper wiring comprises one-third of the weight of a 15-ton satellite.  Half of this wire weight is typically in the EMI shielding.  However that weight reductions must not come at the expense of EMI shielding effectiveness; wiring and connectors are particularly vulnerable to electromagnetic interference.  As an alternative carbon nanotubes (CNTs) when applied as thin-film composites offer effective EMI shielding--they are lightweight highly conductive flexible and strong.

The V-Bat incorporates a ducted fan lift system instead of conventional tail surfaces on a streamlined airframe to provide VTOL performance with aerodynamic efficiency at high cruise speeds.   The prototype V-Bat vehicle has demonstrated all phases of flight under manual control indicating that the system has plenty of control authority in all operational regimes. It has demonstrated excellent aerodynamic performance and robust structural and propulsive functionality. It has the payload/speed/range capability specified in the topic request and we understand opportunities to improve efficiency and mission effectiveness.  Hence we can concentrate on development and demonstration of control algorithms for robust autonomous operation.  We will develop a medium fidelity simulator that includes a 6-DOF dynamic model of the proposed platform that accurately models the lift and drag coefficients and thrust limitations at all angles of attack.  We will design control algorithm for all flight regimes and we will emphasize robustness and safety especially during take-off and landing. We will demonstrate a subscale electric powered V-Bat tailsitter in flight tests.    BENEFIT:  Maximum mission flexibility requires that small UAVs be able to operate anywhere without requiring significant launch and recovery equipment.  A vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) design can solve these problems but achieving maximum duration and range performance similar to the best fixed wing designs has been challenging with conventional VTOL configurations (i.e. rotorcraft).   Rotorcraft typically have poor range performance due to the excessive induced drag of the rotor system. They are mechanically complex and pose greater danger to ground crews because of their exposed high-speed rotor blades.    The V-Bat’s combination of VTOL operational convenience with the safety of a shrouded fan and with fixed wing duration in a small UAV system will revolutionize the availability and utility of local situational awareness for UAV operations from confined areas.   We are keenly aware of the mission pull for Tier II sized long endurance VTOL vehicles. Our design was originally solicited by a commercial customer for aerial photography. We have been approached by potential customers in several government agencies and by commercial groups seeking an anti-piracy solution.

Several airframes will be considered as part of the overall Sensor/Jammer architecture to include Small-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms. These platforms would support Mobility Air Force (MAF) aircraft and the standoff jammers deployed in support of them. Critical challenges include sensing/geo-locating LPI Threat emitters communicating their locations to the standoff jammer in real-time while using extremely high sensitivity lightweight and low power sensor and communication systems technology. Further the system concept must be consistent with the Air Force Layered Sensing Architecture and provide a network-centric solution for delivery of data from the sensor platform to all appropriate layers within the architecture. This activity will develop the concept for the sensor sub-system and data link their nominal interface requirements and the hardware and software requirements that will define a system capable of demonstrating the concept.   BENEFIT:   It is anticipated that the resulting Phase I and II studies provide not only an end-to-end solution for the Support Jammer Queuing requirement but will also provide building blocks for other Dual Use Missions. Examples of those potential missions are highly portable high sensitivity directional RF sensors flexible low SWaP future data links for LOS OTH and potential SATCOM solutions along with the numerous variations based on the building block integrations.

This concept limits spending by focusing investments only for key capabilities. With this concept Research and Development at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) now also needs to be such that  funding is focused on R&D that supports these key capabilities.  AFRL has developed a Capability Focused Technology Investment (CFTI) philosophy that utilizes top down planning to support their strategic planning process. This has resulted in a suite of programs that support LRS vehicles UAVs sensorcraft suites and weapons platforms that are quantifiable through numerical modeling. Unfortunately this only extends to the platform level; the subsystems and payloads are not prioritized. To resolve this issue and to enable subsystem/payload strategic planning Modelogics has developed Model Engineer a tool that is capable of modeling major vehicle subsystems. With selection of this Phase II proposal this capability will be extended to all major vehicle subsystems as well as all relevant platform payloads. Once all these payloads and subsystems are developed Model Engineer will be demonstrated to work with AFRL/VA CFTI modeling process as well as with competitive future systems.","F2-2399","AF04-243","04.1",

The system will use aircraft state and pilot activity information and mission domain knowledge to moderate crew interaction with numerous onboard associate systems depending on current system context.  A key innovation in the ACUM is its use during Pre-Mission Planning and/or Rehearsal phase so human-system automation issues are addressed before the mission begins.  Case-based reasoning and rule induction techniques will capture and assimilate a wide range of Army Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for UAV management.  During the mission the AUCM will use real-time onboard and off-board data sources to match previously encountered situations in the case database and coordinate with the crew to adapt existing cases for use in new situations.  The system will be demonstrated in the Air Maneuver Battle Lab Ft. Rucker AL.  ACUM as a commercial product is applicable to most systems involving supervisory control of semi-autonomous robotic entities.  Military and some civil applications include a range of UAVs and robotic ground vehicles.The principal benefit of the intent inferencing is that it provides an implicit means of human-machine communication - the pilot can communicate with the intelligent system simply by performing the mission much like an effective human team does. The AUCM thus will enable crews to interact with complex automation such as UAVs  in a similar way that crews coordinate with each other. Crew intent information allows tasks to be performed without explicit crew command and errors can be detected before they result in incidents and accidents.  World-wide the UAV market is a multi-billion a year enterprise with a double digit growth rate.  AUCM can increase the effectiveness and reduce the crewing requirements for both airborne and terrestrial based control.  Put another way few operators will be able to control more vehicles.  In addition to the military applications civil applications for sea and uninhabited area surveillance will soon develop.  Target customers include the over forty companies involved in UAV development and production of UAVs. e.g. Boeing Lockheed Martin Bell Helicopter Textron and several Japanese companies.  Intent inferencing is broadly applicable to military and civil supervisory control systems where the human supervisor may be performing multiple tasks or has highly variable workload.","A2-0745","A01-083","01.2",

Our approach will use an agile modeling techniques to rapidly design an RPA and Apache Longbow-compatible intent inferencer that accurately and reliably estimates human operator activities and goals based on pilot actions mission goals and constraints and aircraft state and employs state of the art techniques for resolving uncertainty with minimal operator interruption.  Our modeling techniques will allow us to rapidly identify  document and communicate system requirements and implementation constraints focusing the majority of design time addressing the context model and the challenge of reasoning under uncertainty.

However their small size and achievable speeds increases their sensitivity to the effects of atmospheric disturbances such as winds. This increased sensitivity can lead to a significant degradation in their ability to prosecute a given mission or worse yet the potential for vehicle upset and loss.  The bottom line to the UAV customer in these situations is loss of their “eyes on target” and potential increased risk to forces on the ground. Most operations of UAVs today are forced to make a trade-off between mission effectiveness maintained by fighting the disturbance and energy extraction which is often done by “giving in” to the disturbance at the expense of the mission.   However this trade-off does not have to be a zero-sum game. Wind provides a ubiquitous source of potential energy to enhance UAV flights. Through the research proposed herein the Mosaic ATM team will create sensor processing and control algorithms that leverage wind energy with consideration of the objectives of the mission to maintain mission effectiveness while increasing endurance.

This approach has benefited the development of Air Traffic Control (ATC) over the last century in many ways including a low-level of required aircraft equipage and the ability to handle contingency situations and adapt to new requirements easily. However the reliance on voice communication in ATC operations presents challenges to the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs). The remote pilot must interpret each ATC command direct the aircraft accordingly and communicate the appropriate response back to ATC.  In this proposed effort we apply advanced speech recognition concepts to the interpretation of ATC communications to enable autonomous communication between ATC and the Unmanned Aircraft (UA) removing the remote pilot from the communication loop between the UA and ATC.  The key challenge in this approach is to ensure the required level of accuracy and reliability of the ATC speech recognition. To achieve complete autonomy the UA must also be able to generate and transmit an appropriate response to ATC clearances. Thus we do not require a speech recognition capability alone but rather we require a fully autonomous command and control capability on-board the UA.  BENEFIT:   A number of potential opportunities exist for the UAACS technology including integration into future UASs or as a retro-fit into current UAs as well as application to civilian ATC automation system needs. The UAACS technology has the potential to reduce the workload of the UA remote pilot during airfield ground operations while allowing mission planning to be conducted more efficiently insofar as ground operations planning is concerned. In the civilian ATC market there are many situations in which ATC clearances are only specified by voice command and are not entered into a computer system. In such situations both ATC computer systems and aircraft-borne computer systems do not have access to the clearance requirements. The Automatic ATC Speech Recognition capabilities could be directly applied to this market need.","F2-4672","AF073-089","07.3",

If GPS information is denied the only source of guidance is the INS system which is subject to drift and other errors resulting in degraded performance.  When GPS is denied the performance of these weapons is dramatically reduced to the point where they may be totally ineffective.  To deny GPS simple L-Band jammers can be used by the enemy.  This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that the cost associated with a medium powered GPS jammer is small compared to the cost of most weapons.  Multiple GPS jammers can be placed strategically around a target of interest and can be very effective at denying detection of the target of interest.   The solution to this problem is to develop a munition / submunition concept that can be launched from an unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) from a range of 50 nmi. remain airborne for over 20 minutes and detect and kill a 10-watt GPS threat located within an uncertainty region of 5 km. The goal is to detect isolate home-on and kill the single threat transmitting the maximum signal with each submunition.    Mustang's proposed solution to this problem addresses the requirements for adequate angular separation (to resolve multiple emitters) a small low-cost weapon delivery system (i.e. munition / submunition that can be carried by an UAV) and a fuzing / warhead solution that can produce an acceptable probability of kill (Pk).  Simple monopulse processing will not be sufficient to resolve the multiple emitters.  An adaptive processing approach is required.  To meet the requirements for both a small platform and high angular resolution at L-Band a trade study must be executed between the adaptive antenna placement and the munition / submunition size and shape in order to determine the "best-value" solution to the Government.

We will identify turret and flow control alternative configurations and consider them parametrically for the intended flight regimes advancing the promising options to higher fidelity modeling.  We will use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of the turret configurations considering both aero-mechanical and aero-optical properties of the flow and how these change with increasing Mach number and when flow-control modifications are included.  From the CFD modeling we will conduct comprehensive beam control analysis considering jitter disturbances on optics and the influence of adaptive optics compensation thereby quantifying the residual disturbance environment for laser operation and potential synergies for flow control and beam control technologies.  To facilitate future seamless integration of aerodynamic modeling and beam propagation modeling we will develop a software design for incorporating an aero-optics propagator into WaveTrain models allowing direct simulation of the full effects of aerodynamic disturbances on a tactical laser weapon system.  Dr. Matthew Whiteley will be Principal Investigator for MZA and Dr. William Coirier will be lead for Kratos/DFI.  BENEFIT:  Integration of laser projection turrets onto transonic and hypersonic airframes is a new and challenging environment for laser directed energy weapons.  Using the techniques developed in this program a weapon system designer will be able to reliably assess the disturbance conditions which will be experienced during flight given the planned configuration on the aircraft.  The simulation methods developed here bring together validated aerodynamics opto-mechanics and wave-optical modeling methods to provide realistic simulation of the aircraft turret in the design phase.  Using these tools a weapons engineer can identify potential barriers to laser operation on an airframe in flight regimes and for aircraft configurations that may be difficult or too costly to test.  In addition to laser projection from aircraft optical and opto-mechanical issues for turret-based sensor systems on aircraft can be evaluated.  Aircraft-based surveillance and reconnaissance systems could be simulated and imaging resolution capability quantified.  Design options for sensor systems on aircraft platforms can be thoroughly addressed avoiding costly flaws which may hinder operations of a fielded system.  Aircraft design companies could use these techniques to quickly prototype solutions for active or passive sensing especially on UAV platforms providing a competitive advantage for this growing market.","F103-001-0499","AF103-001","10.3",

A disturbance will be generated based on the predictions for aero-optics distortion for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).  The adaptive optics system will use a liquid crystal spatial light modulator (LCSLM) instead of a continuous surface deformable mirror (DM).  A wave optics simulation including models of the EBS and LCSLM will be validated against the laboratory experiment and used to predict performance of an operational system.

This greatly reduces the aero-optical distortion in addition to reducing weight and power requirements and improving the aerodynamics of the aircraft.  Use of the LCSLM instead of the DM further reduces weight and power.  Adding the aero-optics predictions and wave optics simulations gives MZA a comprehensive ability to design and deliver a lightweight low-power laser communications system for a variety of military and civilian aircraft.

Satellite providers are moving away from deploying   a few large geosynchronous satellites to deploying tens even hundreds of smaller   satellites at low-Earth orbit and medium-Earth orbit where the orbital altitudes are   ranging from 500km to 14000km. This new generation of LEO and MEO satellites offers   a considerable opportunity for the ONR UAV program.

Such windows serve as primary protection for sensitive multi-band electro-optic instrumentation or sensors in aerospace platforms (missile aircraft UAV rotorcraft etc.).  It is critical in most of these applications that the hyperspectral window resist erosion from raindrops and dust encountered during flight and that spectral transmittance is not degraded as a result.  Multispectral Cleartran windows have poor erosion resistance and so a protective coating is required for applications where impact with sand dust or raindrops is anticipated.  Furthermore the relatively high refractive index of Cleartran windows causes significant reflection losses at each material interface unless special anti-reflective coatings are applied.  Nanohmics proposes an applied research program with the aim of creating and characterizing a patterned surface for Cleartran windows that reduces optical reflections over a broad spectral range in addition to providing enhanced protection from rain and sand erosion.  BENEFIT:  The continued design and development of coating and patterning technology and the successful construction and demonstration of initial prototype hyperspectral windows to provide to development/manufacturing partners for airborne testing are the overall goals of the program.

Extremely durable SM-MR skins exhibit high DC and RF conductivity up to -88 dB EMI SE upon repeated severe disparate shape configurations.  While the conductivity is high enough for morphing without the need for embedded wires a novel ultra-lightweight materials solution is offered to increase the efficiency of the triggering method.  SM-MR is produced via an elegant continuous self-assembly manufacturing method that allows for multiple controlled constitutive electromagnetic properties within all axes of the nanocomposite over macroscale areas.  NanoSonic shall demonstrate enhanced skin responsivity in the laboratory a wind tunnel and low altitude flight testing to increase the TRL to 6.  TRLs 8 and 9 would be achieved upon demonstration of SM-MR (Tg = 125&#61616;C) with <10 second repeatable in-flight reconfigurations on a UAS approved by Air Logistics Centers.  BENEFIT:  NanoSonic would produce highly flexible electrically conductive durable corrosion-resistant morphing skins as multifunctional adaptive and protective shielding materials and as unique interconnecting skins for aerospace microelectronic and biomedical systems.  SM-MR will be primarily transitioned onto morphing aircraft to ensure efficient wing morphing and electromagnetic stability during disparate vehicle configurations.  Additional military applications for various forms of the Metal Rubber™ nanocomposites include biomimetric systems thermal control system materials actuators lightning strike protection RF shielding for large area structures and sensors.  Dual-use civil applications include low modulus conducting electrodes for high strain mechanical actuator and sensor devices such as in medical prostheses or implanted bio-electronic devices lightweight mechanical electrical and thermal interconnection of electronic components on conventional circuit boards and lightweight electronic flex circuits flexible displays and smart electronic fabrics and mechanically flexible coatings for systems requiring physically-robust electromagnetic shielding ground planes or electrical interconnection.","F093-127-1411","AF093-127","09.3",

The objective of this project is to develop UAV concepts for a lightweight low cost UAV with an endurance of at least 18 hours with a payload sufficient to meet mission requirements. There are three main elements of this project the vehicle the payload and the ground control/launch capability. The project will investigate various high aspect ratio wing configurations including constant chord (straight wings) swept blended and joined wing configurations. Winglets will also be examined since they offer a real opportunity to increase the lift to drag coefficient. Multi-surface aerodynamic modeling programs will be used to examine these variations analytically and will also use simulations to determine which offers the best opportunity to achieve the required endurance.

Since all of the codes broadcast by the same satellite are coherent in phase this approach allows the combined signal power of all of the GPS codes to be leveraged for anti-jam protection.  By applying data-aiding it is also possible to extend the coherent integration interval beyond the 20 msec data bit period which allows J/S levels approaching 100 dB to be theoretically possible.  Our previous research has shown that to achieve these high A/J protection levels both the inertial and the clock phase prediction error must be kept small during the integration period.  Under this proposed SBIR effort we plan to develop an Inertial Compensated Crystal Oscillator (ICXO) that will allow the clock phase variations to be predicted and compensated within the UTC processing.  This will allow the UTC coherent integration period to be extended further improving the A/J protection possible using ultra-tightly-coupled GPS/inertial systems.    Under Phase I we will develop a design for the ICXO and evaluate its performance in a UTC solution using generic missile and target models to be provided.   This effort will demonstrate by simulation that the design technique provides significant anti-jam immunity and robustness to vehicle dynamics. Under the Phase II effort we will  integrate and test the ICXO with our GPS/INS UTC test-bed.    The Phase II and III effort on this SBIR is visualized to produce perhaps the highest anti-jam GPS receiver built to date yet the design allows for this to be built at a very low marginal cost relative to existing or future GPS receivers. It is proposed to apply this technology first to Cruise Missiles low flying UAV's air to ground weapons and other platforms that must approach close to jammers or must linger over the battle space.

The GI-Eye payload includes a camera and GPS/inertial unit for registering the camera images. This design will be compatible with small UAVs such as the FINDER Aerosonde and Silver Fox. This will be used to accurately geo-reference the ocean’s surface within the cameras view with sufficient accuracy to estimate spatial character of the directional wave spectra and infer water depths.  The traditional approach is to infer water depth from the wave characteristics observed. The relationship between the video signal and the true sea surface elevation currently is determined by an unknown (at least in details) modulation transfer function (MTF). However the substantial inaccuracies that result from the use of an estimated MTF has limited the use of video images being used to provide depth charts.   We also propose to evaluate an improved algorithm under this SBIR that provides the capability to measure wave height directly using a unique stereo video concept. A new algorithm will be developed to estimate the wave height from pairs of the GI-Eye images using the precise meta-data provided by the GI-Eye. A successful NAVSYS Micro-Camera development that uses direct wave height measurements will be a significant advance in technology. Other important wave information such as height and direction will also be generated with precision.  Under Phase II the proposed Micro-Camera GI-Eye capability will be integrated and tested on a small UAV.

A  highly reliable accurate landing system was desinged through the use of  pseudolites to augment the GPS constellation.  An innovative pseudolite design is proposed that provides an additional  highly accurate measurement to iad the navigation solution a highly  reliable 1000 bps communication link to the aircraft to pass differential  corrections and does not interfere with the GPS satellite signals even  at close range.  An innnovative Advanced GPS Receiver design is also proposed to be  employed that is capable of making highly precise code and carrier  measurements from both satellites and pseudolites and optimally  combining these in a differential GPS solution.  The system integrity is  assured through the use of a Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring  (RAIM) algorithm.  The combination of the satellite and the pseudolite  signals provide sufficient redundancy and geometry that 100% availability  is provided for navigation and also for reliable failure detection  through RAIM.  Under the Phase II effort a prototype GPS Autolanding system will be  built and tested to demonstrate the performance of the GPS landing system  under laboratory test conditions.  An option is also included to  integrate the system in a UAV and perform flight tests to demonstrate the  system performance.   Anticipated Benefits:  The proposed system will provide the capability to  support close short medium and long-range UAV missions from both  land-based and ship-board facilities.

The self-healing characteristic will maintain the superhydrophobicity of the coating as the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) undergo wear and tear as a result of routine operations. The coating has been designed to meet the demanding requirements of anti-icing coatings and hence will address the Armyâ€™s need to prevent ice accumulation on UAVs. The specialized design and construction of UAVs make them vulnerable to inclement weather especially conditions favorable for ice formation. In Phase I we propose to demonstrate the anti-icing capability of a superhydrophobic nanocomposite coating consisting of an organic-inorganic hybrid binder with a dispersion of nanoscale particles combined with a self-healing functionality. The coating is sprayable. The technical concept laid out in the present proposal represents a significant advancement of the state of the art in anti-icing coatings.

Atmospheric meteorological conditions (temperature humidity wind speed and direction) affect numerous types of military activities.

NexGen Aircraft Corporation developed tactical-class UAS capable of carrying a 15 lb ISR/directed energy (DE) payload for up to 24 hours to bridge the capability cap of existing UASs.  A light-weight high-aspect ratio highly-optimized aircraft constructed using rapid prototyping methods can achieve a system cost goal of $50000. The DE payload will include laser target identification and designation.  The aircraft will be launched using either a trolley or a pneumatic launcher and recovered via a parachute.  This system will employ advanced autopilot and navigation systems to be simple enough for a non-pilot operator to control.  It will be capable of having vehicle and payload control transferred to a forward operating team.   It will use commercial-off-the-shelf electronic components to minimize the system’s cost and ensure seamless integration into existing networks.  Phase II will demonstrate the system’s capability as it is manufactured and flight tested.  BENEFIT:  The purpose of this engineering development is to produce a tactical-class UAS available at a cost of $50000 or less.  This vehicle will have an intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) mission with a 24 hour maximum endurance.  This system will have a directed energy (DE) payload capable of laser target identification and designation.  In addition to being inexpensive non-pilot operators will be capable of using this system with minimal training.  This system will then be used to operate existing and flight test future military and civilian payloads due to its flexible plug and play design. On the battlefield this system will offer combat commanders (COCOMs) significant mission capability including persistent ISR precision target location and designation base protection battle damage assessment and battle management.  This system is capable of being launched from safe zones and flying behind enemy lines to allow forward operating troops to control the vehicle to have real-time intelligence and precision targeting capabilities.  This system will provide the military additional capabilities allowing the military to become more efficient and effective while reducing the risk of casualties.

The goal is to use Digital Beam Processing (DBP) methods to manufacture patterned arrays of GNRs to maximize heat conductivity to dissipate heat from laser modules. By milling the semiconductor substrate and patterning the GNR heat pipes we will make use of most efficient graphene-substrate interface to maximize heat conductivity; thereby extending the lifetime and increasing performance of the laser. In Phase I we will perform lifetime experiments of the laser transmitter with the GNRs to aid the conductivity of heat away from the device and compare to device performance without the GNRs in order to qualify our hypothesis. Phase I will enable us to establish a figure of merit for the lifetime of the laser transmitter and validate thermal management via GNR heat pipe design to provide a basis for the realization of a prototype device.  BENEFIT:  The NexGenSemi Corporation/Sandia team is presenting process technology for manufacturing efficient heat sinks using graphene nano-ribbon devices based on custom edge termination profiles of patterned GNRs using DBP methods. Realization of these new heat sinks made from single layer graphene will have many commercial applications due to their high reliability non-fouling of the environment during operation and as a renewable energy source.  GNR based thermoelectric film devices are ideal for applications like on-chip heat recovery cooling and power generation alternative energy sources heat flux sensors and fluid flow sensors. A successful outcome on this program will help find a solution to the current challenges for producing highly efficient thermoelectric generators using available bulk materials and standard CMOS microelectronics processing in large volumes. NGSC’s has the unique ability to pattern the substrate-graphene interface to allow for maximum heat conduction away from the device. Also NGSC has the ability to etch the graphene sheet to engineer the GNRs design to allow for well-defined edges and precise dimensions to maximize the heat conduction.

Use of highly conductive materials which have previously demonstrated performance at least as good as copper at the desired frequencies woven into the structural materials will enable antennas to be more simply mounted on a UAV. This ease of integration will also reduce the required structural modifications weight of the antenna system and drag on the vehicle. Additionally by using different mounting points the antenna performance can be improved. This will lead to fewer antennas or more capability for the vehicle. By using structural excitation technology which team members have worked on previously the antenna size can be quite small compared to the frequency enabling lower frequency capabilities on small vehicles.     The team will review multiple conductive materials to ensure that the one with optimal performance in the desired frequency band is used. The final material will be woven into a demonstration article and tested to validate performance simulations.    BENEFIT:  Currently small UAVs are not able to have low frequency antennas at the commonly used UHF and VHF frequencies do to the size of the antenna required to pick up the transmissions. By using structural excitation technology the whole vehicle can be used as an exciter for the antenna allowing the actual element and associated hardware to remain much smaller and lighter for these low frequencies. Enabling these vehicle to access the VHF and UHF frequencies will greatly improve their capabilities and usefulness to the warfighter on the front lines.     In addition to providing improved performance for new vehicles integrating conductive materials into existing composite structures will allow these structural excitation antennas to readily replace existing antennas or be added to a vehicles existing EM suite. Simply replacing some of the skin panels with ones incorporating the highly conductive material will allow any vehicle to use the structural excitation technology and effectively operate much larger antennas covering much lower frequencies than is possible now.

The three electrolytes to be explored are: (1) NOHMs Electrolyte (2) NOHMs Cross-linked Electrolyte (3) and Ionic-liquid Hybrid Electrolyte. These electrolyte compounds exhibit strong mechanical properties which frustrate lithium dendrite formation are non-flammable / volatile and 7x higher lithium transference than pure ionic-liquid electrolytes.  The proposed electrochemical coupling of Li-S increases theoretical storage capacity from 0.6 kW/kg (for li-ion) to 2.3 kW/kg (for li-sulfur) yielding a dramatic 3-4x weight size and cost reduction for batteries in mobile devices EVs and utilities power storage. However a commercially viable Li-S cell is yet to be realized. The technology has so far been hindered by poor electrical conductivity of sulfur and shuttling of higher-order polysulfides during charging (which seriously degrades performance). However NOHMs proprietary nanostructured cathode material prevents higher order polysulfide shuttling between electrodes and facilitates electron migration within the highly conductive carbon.

These applications require a radio aboard the UAV to establish a data link with ground units.

The NORS system includes an innovative narrowband ranging technique that is tightly coupled with the OFDM waveform.  Furthermore the implemented system will be capable of establishing range estimates by sniffing conventional JTRS-WNW OFDM data packets.  With no transmitter modifications required a NORS receiver can even derive range estimates from legacy equipment. A networked localization algorithm is also proposed for combining multiple range measurements into the triangulation of each node's absolute position.  Range position velocity and time information will be distributed over the network in a completely ad-hoc fashion.  This will allow the flow of positioning information from advantaged nodes to disadvantaged (GPS-denied) nodes.

Aerial platforms can suspend surveillance SIGINT and C3 payloads aloft for the use of operators and observers. These resources have proven extremely effective when deployed in the field by personnel near the operating area. Such is the case when operating UAVs from forward positions. The Nucleus Scientific team proposes to develop a long endurance UAV capable of operating from forward operating bases in close proximity to personnel and equipment by utilizing a hybrid VTOL/LE (Vertical Take-Off and Landing/Long Endurance) engine. The VTOL/LE system integrates with a low-drag airframe providing launch and recovery without a runway and increased time on-station. The Phase I effort includes conceptual aircraft design integration of the VTOL/LE system flight simulation and performance analysis. The Phase I development path positions the effort for a Phase II prototype build and test. Design criteria include: vertical take-off and landing +5 hours of flight endurance autonomous operation and integration of modular payloads. The resulting system will launch vertically transit to the mission area support the payload for +5 hours of operation return home and land vertically with limited risk of injury to ground personnel and equipment.  BENEFIT:  The proposed long endurance VTOL UAV will allow the Air Force to operate larger airframes from areas that may not have an available landing strip typically required for Tier 2 sized vehicles. The fielding of larger airframes from forward positions will allow for more sophisticated payload packages to be operated for longer periods of time closer to target areas. This advantage precludes transit time to target location and gives commanders and ground forces better information on a more persistent basis. The anticipated benefits of the long endurance Tier 2 VTOL UAV are: launch and recovery without an airfield; endurance comparable to CTOL UAVs; modular payload systems for multi-mission flexibility; and minimal ground support footprint for launch recovery and maintenance operations.  The technology required to develop a long endurance VTOL UAV has direct commercial applicability for future aerospace systems. The Navy and Coast Guard would have particular interest in an aerial platform that can take-off and land from the deck of a ship to provide aerial coverage. Current military platforms that are capable of landing without runways are helicopters and a handful of jet powered aircraft. These systems are plagued by short operating ranges short endurances and extremely heavy propulsion systems all of which limit payload and overall effectiveness. The development of a viable alternative using the proposed integrated VTOL/LE UAV engine could have cascading effects for future unmanned platforms operated by the DoD. As agencies such as the FBI Homeland Security police and similar federal state and local agencies continue to experiment with UAS and as costs decrease these systems will proliferate outside of the military into broader commercial markets. This SBIR effort can further the development and operation of highly capable VTOL UAS thus expanding the market and decreasing future costs. This benefit will be future platforms that can compactly store and operate from marine vehicles used by the Coast Guard and/or similar UAS that launch from automobiles for police agencies.","F112-006-1350","AF112-006","11.2",

Various algorithms such as gait estimation have been developed to distinguish dismounts from other moving objects. Techniques that build high-fidelity 3D models of dismounts are fragile when applied to real imagery (i.e. video mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with limited communication bandwidth and operating in windy conditions). A novel approach is to exploit the information derived from the track state being provided by a tracker to enhance existing methods for gait estimation and 3D target modeling. Specific attention will be given to managing lower resolution EO/IR data and combining the strengths of recently developed concepts in order to provide robust methods for dismount discrimination and feature aided tracking. In addition micro-doppler radar features will be exploited to provide dismount gait estimation which leads to the benefit of a layered sensing approach. The micro-doppler radar features are highly dependent on target orientation to the sensor. Knowledge of this orientation provided by other layers in the sensing network will significantly enhance the radar-based discrimination and classification. The layered sensing paradigm provides opportunities for data fusion at the measurement or track level.   BENEFIT:   The specific problem of three-dimensional multi-intelligence surveillance systems is addressed. The developmental sections of the software can be translated into a real-time system for direct use by the military and civilian reconnaissance communities. Specific DoD programs include instantiations of several UAV sensor platforms the recently deployed Angel Fire system and the evolving ARGUS-IS persistent video platform. UAV video platforms are becoming increasing prolific and provide new opportunities to employ layered sensing architectures. Demonstration of Numerica’s capabilities in the layered sensing problem domain will be directly marketable to civil application areas such as include border patrol and urban surveillance. The recent increase in aerial systems capable of providing persistent radar or video will be appropriate for homeland defense applications that require wide area sensor coverage along with high-confidence tracking solutions. The tracking technology developed under this SBIR will be extensible to private surveillance systems without the need to modify existing hardware systems. As such a licensable version of a matured software suite will be realizable.

The tiered computational framework provides increasing accuracy as a function of available computational power and communication bandwidth. The lowest tier with minimum complexity uses target geo-location kinematics and features such as shape and size for target handoff. The second tier incorporates target appearance with geometric and environmental invariant/covariant target models. In the absence of truly invariant features or models it selects the optimal features that are discriminative in the given scenario. The next tier exploits target context in terms of neighboring targets and scene information to resolve ambiguities. The highest tier uses a feedback mechanism from the SUAV to improve handoff certainty and to recover from association errors. The project further offers analysis of target handoff algorithms with respect to a wide variety of factors including sensor properties communication parameters environmental artifacts available computational power and scene elements. The Phase I effort will include: development of enabling algorithms implementation of the framework demonstration of proof of concept and parametric and quantitative evaluation of the proposed technologies using real and synthetic WAMI/SUAV video.  BENEFIT:  Wide-area motion imagery has proven to be of tremendous use in exploitation and target tracking on ground as it offers coverage of large areas for long durations. Smaller UAVs on the other hand provide much better resolutions on targets but with limited field-of-views. Target handoff from wide-area motion imagery (WAMI) sensor to sensors on small unmanned aircraft systems (SUAS) or weapons can provide autonomous collaborative and persistent surveillance and reconnaissance using networked unmanned platforms.

RNIIRS is the accepted quality yardstick but it is a subjective scene dependent metric ill suited to automation.  Building on past research Observera established that RNIIRS is correlated with the image domain attributes of brightness focus noise and contrast which correlated with the image domain attributes of brightness focus noise and contrast which can be measured automatically in formed SAR imagery.  The digitally measured attributes are used as coefficients to automatically derive an estimate of RNIIRS.  Observera will further refine and integrate the algorithms and estimation techniques developed in Phase I into a prototype system that will automatically estimate RNIIRS in real-time from formed UAV collected SAR imagery.  Furthermore Observera will demonstrate that this methodology can be used to extract metrics that can determine the suitability of an image for ATR processing in the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and recognition (MSTAR) system to lower false alarm rates caused by poor quality imagery.

This will result in a hybrid package which can be integrated into a single circuit board.  This project will produce the first PC-compatible optical processor with dual-use applicability offering dramatic price/performance advances to a number of critical military and commercial applications.  It will offer object recognition performance on par with the latest massive parallel processing supercomputer at a unit cost that is several orders of magnitude less. The objective of the Phase II SBIR is to validate this technology breakthrough for military applications by completing the detailed design and fabricating a number of PC-compatible optical processor circuit boards.  Interested users will then be able to utilize this "engine" to apply software algorithms for performing object recognition in a variety of military applications such as missile guidance automatic target recognition SRT discrimination robotic surveillance and UAV control.  Anticipated Benefits:  Machine vision systems are now limited by their inability to perform high speed object recognition and defect detection. The significantly faster throughput inherent in optical correlation will remove this limitation.

The work being proposed here also would evaluate edge-bonding of Nd:GGG to itself to facilitate larger size crystals than currently able to be grown by crystal growth techniques in order to satisfy the slab size requirements for the Heat Capacity Laser program.

Target identification confidence can be greatly enhanced by interrogating and evaluating several independent target features.  These include:  surface reflectivity surface type (metal vs. organic) target 3D structure target 2D image and surface vibrations indicative of target type and motion.  Dedicating a separate ladar to each or even two functions is size weight power and cost prohibitive—especially for airborne platforms.  Ophir proposes to develop a small lightweight and power-efficient ladar capable of operating in all of these modes (2D imaging 3D imaging Degree of Polarization (DoP) imaging and vibrometry).  Ophir will complete a trade study analyses to determine the optimal ladar system design and perform a proof-of-concept demonstration of the chosen ladar architecture.  In addition data processing architectures capable of exploiting multiple independent target signatures for rapid high confidence target identification will be investigated.  In addition to manned and unmanned air vehicle military uses of the multifunction ladar the civilian and commercial uses for the multimode ladar include Homeland Defense support of civil authorities NASA the U.S. Geological Survey and NOAA.    BENEFIT:   The main benefit of a multimode ladar is to increase the confidence in military airborne targeting and ISR.  A multimode sensor that captures three independent target signatures– imaging (2D and 3D) Degree of Polarization (DoP) imaging and vibrometry-provides a higher level of confidence of identification of ground objects from air platforms than a single sensor.  In addition a multimode sensor with several sensing modalities enables a reduction in the number of sensors needed on an airborne platform thereby minimizing sensor weight size and power consumption.  The multimode ladar also benefits civilian commercial applications such as using the ladar for Department of Homeland Security for UAV border patrol and SBInet pole-mounted sensor pods for border surveillance.  The ladar would also be useful in aiding civilian authorities in locating and identifying targets for law enforcement and search and rescue due to the ability to use imaging polarimetry and vibrometry to aid in improved identification.  The missions of the U.S. Geological Survey and NoAA to classify terrain and objects would also benefit from the multimode ladar.","F083-149-0169","AF083-149","08.3",

The two technologies are OPC’s Holographic Beam Control (HBC) and Nutronics’ Conformal Laser Weapon System (CLAWS). HBC addresses target illumination aimpoint selection aimpoint maintenance and kill assessment; whereas CLAWS addresses target path wavefront control.  Their synergistic use performs target path wavefront control and local phase control:  With CLAWS running a high bandwidth inner loop HBC provides a mid-bandwidth outer loop to compensate stair mode errors and steer the beam to the aimpoint on the target.    During the base Phase I effort the OPC-Nutronics team will develop a complete high fidelity time domain model of the hybrid HBC-CLAWS beam control architecture including wave-optic propagation through turbulence. The model will include all significant physical effects and hardware limitations including time of flight delays processing precision latency misalignments moving turbulence target velocity and rotation target bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) vibration aerosol scatter and sensor noise using 19 and 43 subapertures.  All transmission medium sensor disturbance and actuator models will be individually tested and verified as well as integrated and tested in subsystems and as an entire system.      BENEFIT:  The target application is a conformal HEL system in a jet fighter.  Conformal HEL designs (enabled by the proposed beam control method) promise extremely lightweight high performance and cost-effective options which can enhance utility and speed deployment.      The conformal design and advanced features of the proposed beam control system also make it suitable for imaging.  The HEL system can be a reconnaissance as well as a target engagement tool.  One can foresee deployment on remotely piloted armed unmanned air vehicles (UAVs).  Another application is space-based HEL defense which becomes practical when multiple apertures can be deployed on panels providing both high resolution imaging aimpoint selection and high quality hit spots to defend against space-born threats.     The beam control methods developed during this project are also applicable to ground based space object imaging laser rangefinders as well as commercial aircraft and ship defense.    OPC has already demonstrated success with transitioning technologies developed under SBIR funding to ongoing research and acquisition programs.  In particular OPC is building deformable mirrors to meet the needs of several government and prime contractor customers.","F112-013-0380","AF112-013","11.2",

The approach provides a lightweight and scalable imaging system  immune to atmospheric turbulence and Doppler shifts of fast moving space objects.   The imaging platform can be ground based airborne or in space.  A  0.5-10 m aperture using a lightweight Fresnel film collector provides 5cm 2D resolution and 5 mm depth resolution at 30-1000 km range for space based imagers.  For ground based imagers a 3D image at 2.5 cm 2D and 2.5 mm depth  resolution at 1000 km range is possible using a 20 m diameter aperture built using tiled panels.       During the first six months of the Phase I effort the baseline design of the imager will be defined.  Performance estimates for the baseline design will be based on an analytic performance model of the end-to-end system and the results of high fidelity simulations of multiple imaging scenarios.  During the last three months of the Phase I effort a laboratory demonstration will be designed assembled and tested to validate the analytic performance model.  The project will conclude with the design of the Phase II Prototype.    BENEFIT:  Standard imaging techniques do not provide the capabilities for detecting and identifying space objects.  With space threats increasing and smaller satellites being deployed this capability is becoming a growing need.  OPC’s 3D SCIP approach provides a complete and cost effective solution for this shortfall. The technologies developed under this effort can be applied to many air surveillance systems as well.  As an example the 3D SCIP imager could be coupled to a coelostat can benefit detection of small UAV’s.  To facilitate technology transition OPC already has already identified a major prime contractor.

These actuation technologies can be used for KKV trajectory and attitude control in any speed range both within and outside the atmosphere. Since the actuators are contained entirely within the airframe geometric envelope and because no mass expulsion is involved they offer several advantages over conventional aerodynamic control surfaces and reaction control systems.  Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of using three new internal actuation systems for KKV trajectory and attitude control. Target interception within and outside the atmosphere and engagements containing both endo- and exo-atmospheric trajectory segments were demonstrated. Flight control system robustness was investigated in Monte-Carlo simulations.  Optimality of the trajectories was assessed using numerical trajectory optimization methods. Phase II research will develop designs for internally actuated kinetic kill vehicles using more realistic airframe data. Preliminary mechanical designs actuator sizing model refinement integrated guidance-control law designs trajectory optimization and flight control code generation will be carried out.

Ikonos satellite imagery for the same areas were obtained.  An automated video-to-satellite image registration technique was demonstrated capable of extracting aircraft position (longitude latitude and altitude) and orientation (roll pitch and yaw).  During Phase-I the data analysis was implemented post flight.    The Phase-II objectives are: (i) to design and assemble a small embedded microprocessor system using modular low cost commercial components capable of executing the navigation algorithm in real time (ii)to further improve the accuracy of the navigation algorithms (iii) to tests and demonstrate the system's real-time navigation ability on a manned aircraft and (iv) to design a custom embedded microprocessor system that meets the weight size and power constraints of a SWARM-class UAV capable of managing all platform functions including navigation communications and housekeeping functions.  This system will transition the technology to the Navy's SWARM project and will serve as the primary intelligent processor for managing the UAV activities and functions.   The basis to the video-based autonomous navigation is the ability to extract aircraft position and attitude parameters.  These critical parameters are needed for orthorectification and georegistration of aerial imagery.  OKSI is involved in aerial multi- and hyper-spectral remote sensing operations for precision farming.  Precision farming is based on site-specific application of chemicals when and where needed and at the correct amount.  The data products produced by OKSI are used by the farmers for variable rate applications of chemicals to their crops.  Data production requires that the remote sensing imagery is accurate to within a single pixel.  The algorithms developed under the present ONR SBIR are already helping OKSI to improve its data accuracy and to eliminate an intensive manual effort of georegistering the remote sensing imagery.

VIPR autonomously determines alternate routing to avoid detection engagement or to escape. Designed to work initially within the VTUAV's Ground Control Station's (GCS) Tactical Control System (TCS) environment VIPR's in-flight replanning capabilities can be hosted within the VTUAV's on-board Datalink Control Module (DCM) for total autonomous vehicle operations.

The proposed antenna is conformal and highly suitable for inconspicuous integration within the skin of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) such as the Outrider. This antenna has a greater potential for maximizing the angle-time-frequency diversity in multi-mode applications and is based on a new already proven design developed for wideband sensing applications as part of a University research project.

Swashplateless rotors are desirable for reasons including increased rotorcraft top speed reduced vibration reduced vehicle mass and reduced rotorhead maintenance.  Swashplateless rotor systems utilize on-blade controls (OBC) or individual blade controls (IBC) to adjust the lift created by each rotor blade.  However a limitation of OBC and IBC is that utilizing the OBC/IBC lift authority for collective blade control diminishes the range available for cyclic blade control.  Collective control systems that primarily adjust the root blade incidence angle gives increased lift without reducing the authority of the OBC/IBC.   To provide reduced complexity and weight Orbital Research will utilize all-electric redundant zero-backlash actuators to drive a single mechanism capable of increasing the root blade incidence.  Because the actuators consist of DC motors and a low-volume high-gear-ratio transmission the proposed actuators will be extremely reliable.  If an actuator fails the transmission is individually disconnectable allowing for redundancy to be incorporated into the swashplateless rotor design.  Hence the rotorcraft can maintain normal flight with 2 actuator failures.  The resulting design while aimed at manned single rotor helicopters will be scalable to a range of rotorcraft including UAVs. ","A2-3794","A08-018","08.2",

Using the same measurements that are currently available this approach will improve the a priori model.  This reduces the uncertainty in the control law which in turn can be used to improve performance in flight and improve the accuracy of the intercepting missile approach to ballistic missile defense.  The control law we propose to use is based on ORINCON's novel Kalman filter development and proven control technology.  Improved performance on-line of the control system will clearly benefit the program of the missile defense concept.  However improved control methodology can go well beyond missile systems.

With the increasing emphasis on use of UAVs as a force multiplier and the increasing desire to keep vital combat assets out of threat envelopes a need exists for an autonomous method to discriminate between hostile and nonhostile individuals in a given area.  ORINCON proposes to validate the ability of three critical technologies to support the differentiation of friendly from hostile individuals and quantify the degree of accuracy achieved in the discrimination of friends from foes.  The elements that will be explored are: motion pattern analysis to separate groups of hostile targets based upon cooperate behavior patterns; signature analysis to isolate hostile individuals based upon equipment carried and individual motion cues; and techniques for accrual of evidence over time to discriminate friend versus foe from multiple clues.  At the end of Phase I we will show how each of these technologies support the identification mission and demonstrate the mutually supporting nature of these elements.  This will lead to the development of a robust dismounted identification system prototype in Phase II. This research will lead to a capability to classify dismounted individuals as hostile or neutral.  This ability will directly translate to improvements in force protection for small units increased situational awareness increases in the effectiveness of deployed munitions and reduction in collateral damage.  These improvements will be applicable to all military systems that require automatic surveillance tracking and identification.

To counter this predicament we increasingly rely upon effective force-shaping/force-multiplying technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).  UAVs have successfully provided extended duration mission support persistent sensor presence and much-needed standoff to military campaigns UAVs are a recognized invaluable and irreplaceable component of modern warfare.     Countering the UAV advantage are evermore-sophisticated enemy anti-aircraft systems that difficult to detect and defeat by conventional methods.

Unfortunately the TCS is typically custom built around the heat loads and operating environments.  For an ORS mission both the heat load and the operating environments will be unknown until the needs for the satellite are determined.  Therefore the TCS must be flexible enough to handle a wide variety of loads in a wide variety of thermal environments.    Paragon proposes to solve this issue by developing an integrated Variable Heat-load and External Environment TCS (VHEET) architecture that couples a radiator panel with variable conductance heat pipes (VCHPs).  The VHEET radiator rejects heat to space and the VCHPs act as a thermal regulator allowing more heat to pass to the radiators in high heat load/warm thermal environment conditions and less heat to pass in low heat load/cold thermal environment conditions.  Because the VHEET components are self-contained and passively controlled there are no wire harnesses or fluids to install facilitating quick installation.    BENEFIT:  Since the TCS is often the most customized system on a spacecraft this concept could be expanded to better serve all DoD satellites reducing both the time and cost to get the satellite in the air.  Additionally this TCS concept could be utilized to provide better thermal control of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) whose use is expanding almost exponentially as both reconnaissance and weapons delivery platforms.  Paragon is actively engaged with a number of commercial space companies and NASA to design their thermal control system.  Being able to reduce the integration time will significantly reduce the development and operational costs allowing these vehicles to reach maturity quicker and cheaper than current technology allows.  The application of this proposed TCS could help solve problems associated with the wildly varying thermal conditions on the lunar surface that occur during the course of a lunar day.

The hybrid tailored preform is a multiply woven preform capable of being formed into complex shapes without sacrificing fiber orientation or fiber volume fraction.  This formability is derived from the long discontinuous tow segments which comprise the preform.  The HT Preform concept allows rapid preform fabrication thereby lowering the labor time and hence cost of fabrication.  The Phase I program tasks include discontinuous tow fabrication preform development molding the keel subcomponent mechanical testing and cost analysis.  Pepin Associates Inc. is developing the preform while Boeing in St. Louis is performing the vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) of the UCAV keel subcomponent.  Low cost carbon fibers are used where appropriate to reduce the part cost but most of the cost savoings will likely result from the rapid preforming capability of the HT Preform.  Cost data from Phase I will support an expanded Phase II program to develop the full scale UCAV keel.

By providing these tools we will realize optimal efficiency in mission planning allocation of mission responsibilities to resources and continuous UAV decision and control tasks during mission execution. Our intent is to integrate the AIMS product with the USAF Vigilant Spirit Control Station (VSCS) to demonstrate AIMS operation and to confirm performance gains in achieving mission goals with reduced cognitive load. Three innovative elements are central to our approach: Adaptive Delegation Interface (ADI) methodology a Broad Spectrum of Decision Aids and Adjustable Autonomy. Our work plan in Phase I will focus on cognitive task analysis of the operator to identify specific applications for high impact decision aids for subsequent design and implementation. Specifically we will study the architecture and functionality of the VSCS to establish a plan for integration of the AIMS intelligent aids.  We will employ a modular design that can be easily transitioned to other systems.  BENEFIT:  We plan to develop AIMS for management and control of multiple heterogeneous UAV platforms.  Our system will include automated assistance for planning/re-planning monitoring and controlling coordinating with collaborating force elements and control agencies and operating mission payload equipment to achieve a high level of efficiency and effectiveness in battlespace mission operations.  To accomplish this we will develop demonstrate and evaluate the AIMS first in a developmental setting then in scenario-based AFRL Vigilant Spirit hosted human-in-the-loop evaluations.  Finally we will pursue specific dual use military and civilian UAV applications of the development products to leverage the capabilities of the operators of these systems.  Our commercialization strategy will begin in Phase I. A key part of our core effort will be to define the application of the proposed system for commercial sale in defense security and business markets and to establish an initial strategy for transfer integration and full commercialization.

Our Phase II proposal is based on a full understanding of the problem to be solved and a solid record of achievement in Phase I. The AIMS program goal is to provide a new suite of intelligent agents decision aids and task-oriented job performance aids that will enhance the performance of the multi-UAV operator by leveraging his capabilities while reducing workload.  Specifically AIMS will be a multi-agent system software system with a set of intelligent services that supports a multi-UAV operator in his interaction with multiple UAVs -- and makes is possible for him to do his job much more effectively.  By providing the AIMS capabilities we will realize enhanced efficiency in mission planning allocation of mission responsibilities to resources and continuous UAV decision and control tasks during mission execution.  Our comprehensive Phase II Work Plan provides for: design and implementation of a complete AIMS suite of tools; evaluation in both laboratory and VCSC environments; GIG integration; and creation of a strategy for transition and commercialization of the AIMS products.  BENEFIT:  AIMS technology will find application in a host of military and civilian activities where multiple UAV operations are enablers of mission success and skilled operators are in short supply.  Unmanned aircraft provide means for their operating organizations to expand their situational awareness to extend their communications reach and to broaden their ability to project power beyond their organic human-limited capabilities.  These capabilities support a wide range of military activities both in the battlespace and as assistance to the civilian world.  AIMS technology amplifies the supervisory control capacity of the limited cadre of qualified military UAV operators so that they can exercise these capabilities worldwide and over extended periods of time as the mission may require.  Budgets for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) continue to rise.   But despite billions of dollars invested significant problems still exist in command and control staffing and interoperability.  Consequently the services have established as goals the development and integration of precisely the kind of capabilities we are proposing based on GAO reports and DoD internal analyses. What this means is that the environment for the present R&D results is being clarified standardized and consolidated allowing us to focus our resources on a single product targeting a small number of very lucrative opportunities.","O2-1086","AF093-028","09.3",

Our objective is to enhance an operator's decision making by providing trust cues so that the perceived trustworthiness matches the actual trustworthiness of the system thus yielding calibrated trust.  There are many issues of trustworthiness in the military but the most pressing today is trust in intelligent machine systems as the military moves to a more robotic battlefield. The most important current robotic systems are Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and in particular systems of multiple UAVs. We will provide the operator with visualization tools to diagnose the actual trustworthiness of the system by showing the risk and uncertainty of the associated information. We will measure and model the trust of the operator in real-time and adapt the display so that an operator who wrongly trusts too much is encouraged to trust less and an operator who wrongly mistrusts is encouraged to trust more. We focus on both individual operator’s trust and the transparency of the system. Three innovative elements are central to our approach: Trustworthiness Diagnosis Displays Quantitative Modeling of Trust Calibration in Cognitive Agents and Adaptive Trust Cueing and Real-Time Interface Calibration.  BENEFIT:  Three factors converge to create the need for a military decision-maker to assess the trustworthiness of information in automated systems; these are: uncertainty in data fusion trust in advanced decision support and ubiquitous situational awareness.  These conditions require a human-machine interface that will enhance an operator’s decision-making identify uncertainty in underlying information and calibrate trust adaptively to the operator. The complete ATCI will provide an infrastructure and method for control decisions with guidance based on both the benefits and costs of allocating resources to further uncertainty reduction and on the value of specific collection and analysis options in terms of their potential impact on decisions and UAV mission outcomes. To ensure the utility of our solution we will include in Phase I a functional Proof-of-Concept Demonstration based on a relevant and realistic use case involving a single operator coordinating monitoring and controlling multiple cross-platform UAVs.  Emphasis will be given to the user interface and enhancement of the usability of the integrated system. To achieve this we will conduct human factors and usability analysis of the system functions and user interface. Our approach is supported by an on-going Air Force sponsored SBIR Phase II effort to develop an Adaptive Interface Management System (AIMS) for the USAF Vigilant Spirit Control Station (VSCS).","F121-031-0275","AF121-031","12.1",

This means the radiator can be readily incorporated into arrays or located where there is limited real estate for the antenna.  In our solution there is no resistive loading within the antenna and so it is highly efficient.  We will design several versions of the optimized profile slot antenna throughout the duration of this Phase I project; including a planar version and one that is form fit to a chosen mold line of a flight vehicle.  In Phase I of this project we will also fabricate the ultra-wideband radiators (planar and non-planar) and test their RF characteristics.

Our prototype operates efficiently from VHF to S-band is less than 3&#8243; in height and can be seamlessly integrated with the host platform with a significant reduction in visual signature.  Our high performing conformal antenna technology is equally beneficial to wideband communications links on airborne platforms reducing the number of apertures and aerodynamic drag.

The data must be organized and correlated with other information sources; registered with itself the earth and other imagery; and processed to enhance resolution and extract latent information.  Fortunately industry has spawned a number of COTS software products that facilitate the design of an integrated system that will meet ASC/RA needs.  Our approach is to use COTS Geographical Information System (GIS) and Image Processing packages to build an integrated core framework for managing and processing all forms of reconnaissance data to extract information pertinent to the warfighter. Other organizations and we have developed specialized algorithms that are candidates for inclusion in this framework.  These algorithms perform functions such as geolocation rectification registration fusion enhancement and recognition. We will use our unique expertise in image processing and fusion to evaluate and select algorithms for inclusion in the framework. We will demonstrate the framework design using imagery from key data sources such as SYERS (aircraft IR) ASARS (aircraft SAR) and IKONOS (overhead visible). The software product we envision will be an integrated environment for the exploitation of multi-source imagery and associated data.  Although it will be tailored to the reconnaissance mission it will have wider applicability in other remote sensing applications.  GIS software is well suited to spatial imagery and associated data layers but does not do image processing well or provide an environment for enhancement and exploitation algorithms.  Image processing packages do not deal with associated data layers.  We hope to produce a software product that does all of the above well and which can accommodate specialized algorithms such as resolution enhancement.  We believe that this product will meet ASC/RA needs and that it can be commercialized to serve the entire remote sensing community.  Also specialized algorithms will be hosted in this environment which will meet the need for hyper-spectral sensor resolution enhancement and other image enhancement and exploitation in reconnaissance applications.  Other remote sensing applications have the same need and we anticipate that these algorithms will have commercial application.  It is our intent to commercialize this software product and market it to the general remote sensing community.","F001-0721","AF00-122","00.1",

Recognizing these body activities often is key to determining human intent.  Human activities involve 3D bodies in a 3D environment current imaging technologies try to recognize body activities from their 2D projections.  Photon-X uses proprietary spatial phase imaging technology which acquires high-resolution 3D video imagery in real time. The SPI sensor continuously builds a moving scene into dense 3D geometry. The technology makes possible markerless tracking of non-rigid forms. This enables unprecedented measurement of 3D human activity. Photon-X used the SPI sensor to capture real-time 3D videos of body activities. Photon-X also demonstrated the ability to extract and measure motion parameters from 3D videos by representing activity as a sequence of skeleton motions.

To address this problem Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new structure of cooling system a novel Binary Oscillating Thermoelectric Chiller (BOTEC) for heat power acquisition and transport.  The BOTEC is based on two major innovations: one in the heat-pipe area and the second in the narrow TE area.

The innovative system design results in 5-W operation off a 12-18VDC power source and a 2000 fps 1920-pixel x 1080-pixel imaging capability using parallelized CCD and memory trains. No additional cooling is needed and elimination of complex optics results in a <250 g package suitable for overhead imaging of weapon blast events from small (e.g. Pointer BAT3) UAV platforms. In Phase I POC will survey existing micro-HSV systems and design a complete prototype AHSV camera system to replace existing Sony block cameras. We will also validate the use of our optical segmenting hardware in tiled imaging applications and fabricate a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate our results. In Phase II we will refine our design per client input and fabricate a complete production-ready CHAOS video system.  BENEFIT:  The proposed CHAOS video system will make possible new classes of imaging technologies such as high-resolution high-speed low-cost imager systems. Conventional approaches to fabricating large imaging arrays have either been based on stitching of smaller arrays or actual physical construction of large arrays. Both approaches have drawbacks that are directly overcome by the CHAOS video system thereby allowing POC’s CHAOS to directly extend the capabilities and lifecycles of military and commercial imaging technologies. A unique feature of CHAOS is its capacity to fuse sensor devices in a manner that improves overall performance. The CHAOS video system can employ lower-cost poorer-performing imaging components to provide high-performance operation. This breathes new life into these mature technologies and directly reduces fabrication and design costs of various technologies.","F112-199-0523","AF112-199","11.2",

The Turais UAS was designed to be carried in the bomb bay or wing station of a P-3 Orion on standard 14- or 30-inch BRU lugs and released at up to 30000 ft altitude to perform its mission. Turais has performed two successful unpowered air drop demonstrations from a surrogate aircraft. A scaled down version using a similar layout will be used for the 20 lb payload variant with the option of using the existing two airframes without modification to demonstrate a 500 lb payload delivery. To achieve covert delivery PiAC will employ previous dissertation work by the Principal Investigator for a covert trajectory control algorithm that plans a minimally detectable path to the landing zone based on known observer locations or terrain profiles while accounting for vehicle dynamic limits. In addition PiAC will team with Atair Aerospace to exploit Atair’s extensive expertise in guided parafoil systems which enable the proposed CPADS system to achieve 50-yard landing accuracy.  BENEFIT:  A CPADS UAV as described in this proposal represents significant value to the military for covert resupply. Using a Covert Trajectory Navigation System provides the Turais UAV with a unique ability of enemy avoidance and accurate soft delivery of supplies/sensors. In addition the Turais is a modular system allowing for the insertion of combat munitions to be the primary payload. This gives the Turais UAV to ability to strike enemy targets. The advancement of UAV capabilities is one of the most promising areas of investment which is forecasted to amount to over $20 billion dollars. Furthermore future UAVs are anticipated to play an expanding role in border patrol natural disaster relief and search and rescue services in the future under the direction of other agencies such as DHS the Coast Guard and security contractors. The CPADS would enhance the capabilities of these tasks by providing covert resupply of forces behind enemy lines.    PiAC has designed the Turais Naval UAV for use aboard the Naval P-3 P-8 F-18 and SH-60 Aircraft. The universal BRU-14 airborne carriage system makes the Turais a unique product in the field of UAVs. Key to the Turais migration into land forces will again be its unique characteristics which differentiate the system from other offerings. A key characteristic which has high military worth is the reaction time or speed capability of the Turais (VD = 279 kts). The Turais has a strong structural center section dictated by the need to react high inertial and dynamic loads aboard the F-18 when launching & recovering to the carrier. This allows the Turais UAV to sustain high acceleration without modification to the base core airframe. That transitions to a wide range of capabilities of the Turais UAV. This strategy allows the Turais UAV to keep the production cost low to allow for expendable/ballistic operations.","F103-250-1156","AF103-250","10.3",

It therefore offers to missile defense two wholly new options for detection and tracking of closely-spaced objects (CSOs):    (1) Pixon processing can increase resolution by a factor of four beyond the diffraction limit. It thus can resolve targets at ranges four times greater than otherwise possible increasing the time available for critical decision making.    (2) Conversely telescope apertures can be reduced by a factor of four while holding performance constant resulting in significantly reduced system cost.    We propose to build a modular Pixon processor that will not only demonstrate such resolution enhancement but also significantly decrease noise and achieve theoretically optimum radiometry. The prototype-implemented in field-programmable gate arrays on a single circuit board-will process images of CSO clusters in 0.03 second.  Multiple processors can work in parallel to process larger or multiple images; future implementations in application-specific integrated circuits will further increase speed. In an Enhancement option we propose to interface this core processor with Aeromet Inc.'s AIRS sensors and field test the full system.

It will be incorporated in the Multi-Mode Magnetic Detection System (MMMDS) once it is designed and tested. The outputs of this algorithm are: The three-axis position of the target the horizontal velocities of the target the three axis dipole moments of the target and the turns-per-knot of the target. Using the MT Algorithm submarines may be tracked and identified in deep or littoral waters.  Fixed Wing Helicopter or UAV MAD equipped aircraft will be able to track and identify a submerged target using the MAD Tracker Algorithm. Using a figure eight tracking pattern the ASW aircraft will be able to track after the first two target detections are accomplished. Present ASW aircraft can revisit/detect the submarine using the figure eight MAD pattern every 4 minutes. It is expected that this algorithm will produce positions of the target to less than 100 feet and velocities that are accurate to 0.1 knot. The MT Algorithm will have a variety of commercial and military applications. Although this algorithm's primary focus is tracking and identifying submerged submarine targets in littoral waters it has a variety of applications in the military and commercial markets.

The laser magnetometer has high sensitivity (less than 0.5pT/ÖHz) omni-directional measurement capabilities with no dead zones and band-width to support ELFE measurements and is ideally suited to the UAV applications. The laser sensor was demonstrated to have sensitivity 10X better than the AN/ASQ-81 in the DC to 100 Hz band. The concept for an integrated UAV MAD system including laser magnetometer and ground station functions was developed in Phase I and will be designed in Phase II to meet the UAV sensor volume weight and performance goals. A prototype laser MAD system will be fabricated and demonstrated by ground testing in Phase II. The UAV Laser MAD System will provide the Navy with an advanced standoff capability to map magnetic anomalies and detect classify localize and track a broad range of land/sea magnetic targets without risk to manned assets.  BENEFITS: The laser magnetometer is the first portable miniature resonance magnetometer to offer  high-resolution scalar field information relative to current MAD systems and would be the new state-of-the-art instrumentation for geomagnetic research and space exploration. The laser magnetometer would find application in geomagnetic observatories undersea surveillance anti-shoplifting surveillance ELFE communications receivers bio-magnetic detection and anti-submarine warfare.","","N96-209","96.2",

There are neither enough people available nor intelligent computer algorithms developed to process all incoming sensor data in real-time. To address this problem Team Primordial (Primordial plus partners Panoptic intuVision and Carnegie Mellon University) proposes Tentacle a multi-camera immersive surveillance system.  Simply put Tentacle is software that facilitates quickly understanding what is happening now and in the past.  For its eyes Tentacle uses the ever-growing number of battlefield sensors.  Tentacle fuses sensor feeds into a 3D virtual world comprised of imagery terrain and avatars representing people and vehicles. Tentacle works by integrating real-time feature extraction and tagging algorithms for detecting tracking and identifying entities with rule-based database query and dynamic alert tools for de-cluttering and highlighting relevant events.  In phase I Primordial demonstrated Tentacle’s ability to display a 3D world mimicking reality while supporting queries and alerts.  In phase II Primordial will update Tentacle by improving its static tracking entity correlation metadata extraction and behavior analysis algorithms.  We will also add support for tracking entities from moving platforms (e.g. UAVs) and performing spatial queries.  BENEFIT:  By fusing hundreds of video streams into a single synthesized 3D display and automatically flagging potential security events Team Primordial anticipates that Tentacle will 1) increase an analyst’s event detection probability 2) reduce response time 3) decrease the analyst to sensor ratio 4) reduce fatigue 5) increase job satisfaction and 6) reduce turnover.  Tentacle will benefit large surveillance systems such as those found at airports military bases hotels casinos entertainment venues federal buildings hospitals and large retail operations.  Northrop Grumman has expressed an interest in deploying Tentacle to 114 United States embassies under an existing State Department contract.

Existing wearable dead-reckoning devices relying on inertial measurement units (IMUs) and stride estimates rapidly lose accuracy as the soldier moves and are currently of limited value for the dismounted soldier. However recent advances in computer vision algorithms have opened up the possibility of using low cost cameras (e.g. mounted to the soldierâ€™s helmet) to perform vision-based localization and navigation. The proposed SoldierVision product will build on our partnerâ€™s (Evolution Roboticsâ€™) state-of-the-art vSLAMTM technology which relies on pattern recognition to automatically create a map of the visible surroundings and localize the camera within the environment. Evolution Robotics developed the pattern recognition software for the Sony Aibo robot and has collaborated with the military on projects ranging from RPG detection to UAV autonomous navigation. An impressive recent application of computer vision techniques to localization and navigation was the use of binocular camera-based odometry to assist the Mars Rovers in their semi-autonomous exploration of the Martian surface (a truly GPS-denied environment). At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory our team member Professor Clark Olson spent 5 years working on computer vision techniques for the Mars rovers and we are excited to leverage his expertise in this area. Also Primordial is in an excellent position to commercialize this product having already integrated our patented Ground GuidanceÂ® navigation software into the Armyâ€™s Land Warrior system for dismounted soldiers. In phase I Primordial will develop a prototype version of SoldierVision building on Evolution Roboticsâ€™ innovative vSLAM technology and we will perform a live demo with human subjects in order to realistically assess the feasibility of the proposed system.","A093-149-0751","A09-149","09.3",

(PRA) proposes to develop a real-time error correction processor using multimode tracking for over the horizon radar. In particular PRA will leverage its extensive experience in propagation effects and tracking algorithms coupled with target selectivity algorithms to develop a dynamic real-time mode linking process for over the horizon radar using aircraft beacon data. Ray tracing the radar signals from origin through reflection in the ionoshpere to the receiver on the ground an estimate of the expected modes will be produced. This will be compared with the measured modes to provide a uniform detected track from the multiple propagation modes. The detected tracks will be compared to the true tracks of the cooperative aircraft to form an error surface for minimizing errors on uncooperative targets due to unaccounted propagation phenomena. The error surface will be updated as additional aircraft position measurements become available in order to adapt to changes in the structure of the ionosphere.  BENEFIT:  The problem of multiple propagation modes is a significant issue for over the horizon radar particular during active ionospheric periods. Through the use of cooperative aircraft targets providing accurate aircraft state information in real-time a real-time error surface can be extracted to improve the track performance of over the horizon radars independent of the particular atmospheric and ionospheric phenomena inducing the errors. The successful completion of Phase I will result in an autonomous error correction algorithm using an operations research optimization approach.  The optimization approach applied to multimode tracking can be extended and modified for other engagement applications including air-to-air and ground-to-air engagements.  PRA has already applied a similar approach to force protection against rockets artillery and mortars and to enhanced target selectivity for anti-ship missiles.  The general operations research approach can be evolved from the successful completion of Phase I for applications to include radar and communications mode linking missile engagements UAV operations robotics and operational logistics. The algorithm can also be applied to asset defense in a multiple engagement scenario with many incoming threats for optimum assignment and engagement of targets such as a swarm of small boats attacking a ship or a swarm of low cost rockets attacking a high valued asset. Other anticipated benefits and commercial applications are in resource allocation for first responders disaster planning police chases etc.  In Phase II PRA plans to develop a simulation to demonstration the processing and exercise the interfaces in preparation for a Phase III implementation into an OTHR system. The processing algorithms will need to be numerically efficient for real-time operations and PRA will develop near optimal algorithms that are capable of achieving fast computation. In addition PRA plans assess the algorithms using R-OTHR data from Raytheon.   In the longer term PRA will continue to develop and commercialize products based on the exploitation and mitigation refraction of signals through continuous media.  Applications include acoustic signature mitigation for tactical operations that need to remain silent sonar tracking where multiple reflections of the same track have to be reconciled and identification and mitigation of marine ducting layers that guide radiation in channels of low density air.

We take advantage of recent advances in key components optimization of others and prior experience with satellite-based hardware to enable our advancement in the state-of-the-art for transmitters. The inherent high efficiency reduces the overall thermal load for the system and the use of optical-fiber technology allows distribution of the sources of heat over a large area simplifying thermal management.  BENEFIT:  Our improved fiber-amplifier efficiency allows either: more transmitter power and hence improved link margin for the same electrical power consumption and thermal load or reduced power consumption and thermal load for the same transmitter power. For satellites with solar panels the lower power consumption leads to a smaller satellite footprint thus reduced vulnerability and reduced weight leading to lower launch costs. For UAVs reduced power leads to lower overall weight in the vehicle and less waste heat to manage.

UAVs are clearly visible in day light and easy to identify and hide from or take aim and bring them down.  The best way to address this vulnerability is to make the UAV less visible by making it blend in with the background.  Our active camouflage technology has shown the capability to reduce UAV visibility and our Fast Track partner the Boeing Company has expressed their strong interest in using QD Vision's products on their future military systems.

The 8T BiCMOS process enables the integration of the multi-channel receiver on a single silicon chip at low cost and with low power consumption.

Such developments will result in a significant reduction in the transmission of excess vibration and shock loads to helicopter and aircraft airframe. An effective isolation technology will have applications for isolating vibrations from guns engines and main rotor head transmission mounts in Army helicopters with emphasis on reducing the vibration to the airframe and onboard mission equipment package LRUs.  The goal is to increase the LRU MTBF and lower overall logistics cost.  Vibration and shock attenuation is the focus of this project.  We offer to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the Smart Isolation Mounts for Army Guns (SIMAG) with Energy Flow-Controlling Structural Elements designs suitable for use in military airborne vehicles such as helicopters aircraft and UAVs.  Excess vibration energies will be channeled and attenuated inside the proposed Smart Isolation Mounts whose continuous and connected elements will have energy flow-controlling and energy-managing capabilities. It is the energy-managing and energy-controlling features of the SIMAG that makes our design unique and effective.  This innovative Smart isolation Mount will be designed to be effective and failsafe. The proposed mount creates a barrier between vibration energy generated by guns engines and sensitive optical and electrical components onboard helicopters or aircraft. Vibration and shock disturbances injected into the mounts will be confined diverted converted absorbed steered and dissipated using embedded passive semi-active and hybrid elements.  The semi-active feature of the proposed isolation mount will have the capability of changing it stiffness and/or damping rates in an on-off manner to accommodate operational changes.     Effective isolation mounts have applications in the current commercial piston and turboprop aircraft as well as helicopters. The combination of improved vibration isolation while maintaining static alignment conditions under shock loads will also be applicable to better isolating a variety of military and commercial power trains from the rest of the vehicle.  In addition to airborne types these vehicles include passenger automobiles commercial trucks marine vehicles such as submarines and surface ships.","A2-1003","N01-018","01.2",

The subsequent increase in demands on UAV operators leads to stress and fatigue and consequently results in operator error mission performance decrement and even loss of vehicles or lives. The U.S. military reports mishap rates for UAVs up to 30 times higher than for manned aircraft.      The main goal of this Phase II program is to develop a Closed-Loop Adaptive Aiding System (CLAAS) that improves UAV mission performance by adaptively reducing operator cognitive workload. Using technology developed in part for the USAF under a research program for enhanced C2ISR operator performance we utilize QUASARs breakthrough wearable dry-electrode based physiological monitoring system to measure physiological parameters to classify operator cognitive states (engagement workload fatigue and stress) during a multi-UAV simulation task. The cognitive states are combined with present and future mission context to predict the probability of imminent operator error. To close the loop this predicted performance will feed back to proactively mitigate UAV task demands in order to reduce operator cognitive workload and hence enhance mission performance.       Such a system designed to adaptively mitigate operator-error would be of considerable interest to the DoD or air traffic control.  BENEFIT: The benefits of this system are increased efficiency and safety of UAV control by human operators. Operators will be able to control more UAVs at one time at higher operational effectiveness. There is a large potential market in air traffic control. Commercial UAV applications (such as border monitoring) will also benefit and there are also potential applications in industries such as oil exploration in which operators control underwater unmanned vehicles.","F2-4560","AF073-013","07.3",

However current algorithms are not capable of achieving efficient and effective coordination such as dynamic task allocation and reallocation among large numbers of UAVs due to either the severe bottleneck of centralized algorithms or assumptions of perfect and unlimited communication. In this STTR Quantum Leap Innovations (QLI) in conjunction with the University of Pennsylvania proposes to construct a mathematically rigorous framework for evaluation and refinement of existing distributed coordination and control algorithms for large numbers of UAVs in the presence of limited intermittent and asynchronous communication. Two key features of the proposed highly innovative framework include (1) the development of Token- Based Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP) algorithm for dynamic prioritysensitive task allocation and reallocation; (2) the introduction of limited and intermittent communication to the existing motion planning algorithm for the computation of trajectories for a cluster of UAVs. In Phase I we will focus on development and integration of the high-level DCOP-based coordination algorithm for dynamic task allocation/reallocation and low-level robust motion planning algorithm with real-time spatial and temporal constraints. The feasibility of this approach will be demonstrated with a simple and user-friendly human interface that can enable multiple operators to manage large numbers of UAVs for their time-critical intelligence needs in a simplified simulation for battlefield search and coverage. In addition Phase I option will involve the design of a framework in which we will provide a quantitative analysis of the success likelihood for a sequence of tasks from different operators and ensure each operator has adequate understanding of the capability of the UAV system and the process of tasks allocation and execution.","N074-019-0071","N07-T019","07  ",

Compensation of motion noise is classically achieved by configuring the sensor as a magnetic gradiometer and taking advantage of the fact that the earth's magnetic field is spatially nearly uniform.  Quantum Magnetics working with the Navy and IBM Research has developed a unique sensor configuration the Realtime Tracking Gradiometer (RTG) that solves the dynamic range challenges particularly well.  Operating such a sensor in a low-cost Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) adds still more technical challenge: that of negating locally-generated magnetic interference without compromising the sensor's motion noise immunity or its responsivity to detection targets.  In Phase I we demonstrated the efficacy of two complementary approaches to mitigate local interference.  One developed by Quantum modifies the RTG hardware and another developed by the Navy's Coastal System Center adapts the noise compensation algorithm.  In the Phase II Base effort we will provide the Navy with a version of the RTG specifically designed and ready for AUV integration.  We will support the Navy in sensor integration into an AUV and demonstration at sea.BENEFITS: The technology developed under this program will add to the Navy's organic MCM capability.  It can also be adapted for use in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for locating underground facilities.

The QFS antenna is isotropic compact and accurate in its direction finding performance. However due to its small size the QFS antenna is less sensitive than larger antenna arrays. This is particularly true for the antenna elements that measure the magnetic field components which are in essence induction sensors.   Dr. Antonio Palacios of San Diego State University has explored a novel configuration of sensor arrays and a new method of signal detection known as Residence Time Detection (RTD) which together could lead to dramatic improvements in the sensitivity of induction sensors. This method has already been applied to other types of magnetic field sensors including SQUIDs and fluxgates.

For the advanced device technology we will team with a GaN MMIC foundry such a HRL who is currently the industry leader in millimeter-wave GaN. To enhance the MMIC efficiency we will implement two circuit innovations: 1) we will utilize a push-pull circuit configuration and 2) operate the MMIC devices in a switching mode (Class E). Neither of these techniques has been attempted before at these millimeter-wave frequencies. Simulations described in this proposal indicate that with these techniques device drain efficiencies and PAEs of 60% and 38% respectively are possible. For the power combiner we will implement a novel 2-tier combining system consisting of a 4-way H-tee combiner and a 16-way radial combiner. Finally we will linearize this amplifier/combiner with an approach that employs both envelope tracking (ET) and digital pre-distortion (DPD).

A cornerstone of our approach is the development of a power MMIC with an efficiency of greater than 50%. This will be achieved by employing state-of-the-art wide bandgap GaN (Gallium Nitride) devices in conjunction with two circuit innovations. First we are using switching-mode amplifier concepts to realize these efficiency levels. This has never been done before at this frequency. Secondly we are employing a push-pull amplifier configuration for further improvements in efficiency and harmonic content. Using this combination computer simulations indicate that drain efficiencies of 70 percent are possible. Finally we are utilizing Envelope Tracking (ET) or possibly Pulsed Load Modulation (PLM) to linearize this switching-mode amplifier. This also has never been attempted before at this frequency. Simulations described in this proposal indicate that with this innovative approach we can simultaneously achieve both the linearity and efficiency goals of this program. In fact simulations indicate that with an output power of 1 watt we can achieve PAE levels of 40% or more while maintaining an adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of better than -40 dB.  BENEFIT:   Future MILSATCOM terminals require linear high-efficiency power amplifiers for ground terminals. Linearity is required in order to prevent spectral regrowth i.e. extraneous power from one channel interfering with signals in adjacent channels and high efficiency is required to minimize both power consumption and self-heating which in turn causes thermal stress. Currently available Q-band power amplifiers simply cannot simultaneously satisfy these linearity and efficiency requirements. Employing innovative switching amplifier concepts our approach addresses this need. Applications for linear high-efficiency amplifier technology abound for agencies other than the Air Force ranging from SATCOM applications for the Army in the 29.5 to 31 GHz band to radar applications for all military services in the radar bands (33 to 38 GHz). For radar high efficiency is particularly important for airborne applications such as UAVs and fire control radars where the prime power is limited.","F083-155-1621","AF083-155","08.3",

The benefits include practically jam-proof and interference-proof operation resistance to many deleterious on-air propagation effects extremely limited transmitter complexity inherently error-correcting demodulation and configurable band occupancy.    The MVSK format achieves its many advantages through the unique integration of a number of advantageous RF techniques including the use of fast and variable frequency-hopping a dual-detection demodulation method bare-carrier sense modulation and intelligent baseband signal processing.  In one example case a 64-VSK link operating at 1.44 Mbps in the 4.4-4.9 GHz band with a 1E-5 BER would exhibit a worst-case 18 dB jamming margin.  Compared to a traditional high-order modulation format like 64-QAM at the same data rate MVSK shows a worst-case 34 dB jamming margin advantage and 5 dB transmitter power advantage meaning longer range performance especially in the congested real-world environment.  These advantages are actually even much greater when the effects of intelligent MVSK baseband signal processing and the bare-carrier modulation approach are considered.   The potential military applications for range telemetry operational flight vehicle command and control unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) command and telemetry links troop instrumentation and covert operations are significant even if taken alone.  No other existing modulation format offers the particular mix of advantages that MVSK brings to the table thus providing huge incentives to potential MVSK adopters.  Current active efforts in commercialization include the the use of MVSK as the core technology for wireless shipboard controls in advanced maritime applications.    The commercial potential to apply the highly scalable MVSK technology to operations in the existing unlicensed FCC Part 15.249 bands under the frequency-hopping rules opens up a set of large market opportunities for users who need to be able to co-exist with the exploding 802.11 wireless local area network (LAN) market expected proliferation of disruptive Bluetooth short-range links and currently existing cordless phones and industrial scientific and medicine (ISM) devices.

There is a critical need to incorporate advanced anti-jam techniques such as STAP and SFAP into UVA GPS receivers; however this normally requires the use of optimized multi-element CRPA antenna.  The focus of this effort is to replace the multi-element CRPA with a number of fixed reception pattern antenna (FRPA) that will facilitate STAP/SFAP anti-jam techniques.  For the phase I effort RBS Technologies and its subcontractor Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems plan to develop alternative architectures  that combine several FRPA antennas into a pseudo-CRPA array together with the required subsystems and digital signal processing for incorporation of STAP/SFAP into a UAV GPS receiver.  The antenna arrays are realized using existing FRPAs and alternative architectures will be considered for RF down conversion and STAP/SFAP processing.  Anti-jam performance will be assessed using MATLAB/SIMULINK models and preliminary subsystem circuit simulations. The Phase I effort will result in identification of a viable approach for the use of the FRPA array antenna to implement anti-jam capability into UAV GPS receivers.

The dense field concept is in direct support of the N88 Air ASW Vision Statement which states that “continued pursuit of the miniaturization of sonobuoys including the EER sources and receivers is important for overcoming load restrictions and maximizing search area coverage and prosecution response flexibility.” The SBIR solicitation cites several processing advantages that a dense field has over longer range systems.  Improved ability to make environmental predictions greater chance of multiple detections and increased usable bandwidth are some of the primary advantages.  The Navy is seeking a processing architecture that is modular to allow easy substitution and evaluation of algorithms intended to exploit these advantages. Our Phase I approach is to first define a modular baseline impulsive signal processing architecture for use as a standard.  Next we plan to perform a performance analysis of a number of innovative algorithms identified in the solicitation using simulated data.  If selected for the option we plan to host the baseline modular architecture in the RDA L-CAP processor in preparation for evaluation with real data in Phase 2. BENEFITS: The newly developed modular signal processing architecture will provide the SH-60 and UAV platforms with a processing framework to evaluate improved detection and classification algorithms intended to exploit the advantages of the dense field concept.   The goal of this effort is to merge the technology and algorithms developed and evaluated in Phases I and II into the Navy’s dense field ASW system as a planned product improvement program in Phase III.  In terms of non-military potential the proposed sensor could be used for monitoring the migration paths of marine mammals.

One of the most pressing needs for various DOD departments is the capability to recognize or to identify unknown targets when no signal is available from a target to indicate the type of target that it may be.  The set of unknown targets that can exist is extremely large and can include commercial and military aircraft helicopters cruise missiles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  The proposed research is focused on developing a fusion algorithm and a analogous simulation concept to asses the performance of the fusion algorithm that: (1) addresses the fusion of multiple sensors; (2) is inherently expandable to support future growth; and (3) allows an identification of the necessary software/hardware components by availability vs. need to develop or extend.  The end product (Phase Three) for this effort would be a fusion algorithm that with respect to a single recognition technique alone significantly increases the probabilities for correct recognition/identification of airborne and sea targets that are within or beyond visual range. If the proposed research is successful it can have tremendous impact on numerous weapon systems that have a need for Non-Cooperative Target Recognition/Identification.  The ability to achieve NCTR has been sorely needed by all DoD services.  It has the potential to give the battlefield commander better control over his resources and to reduce logistics' requirements considerably.  With this technique the battlefield commander will have a capability to determine which of his resources is the most applicable for any threat engagement scenario.  This can reduce operating and support costs significantly.  Not only can costs be reduced but also better weapon system performance can be realized.  The methodology could be applied to fuse multiple sensors together at airport location to improve air traffic control and relieve the coordination and stress that air traffic controllers are under.  On commercial aircraft information must be fused together to present information to the flight crew in an efficient manner.  This technology allows this to take place.","B021-0584","BMDO02-009","02.1",

Fires and Effects missions bring an additional challenge because they require real-time coordination between battlefield assets and fine timing control. Therefore integration of Fires and Effects M&S and autonomous systems requires a technology that meets real-time constraints. The solution must bridge different protocols and formats while maintaining the real-time latency and high throughput.  Real-Time Innovations (RTI) proposes an innovative architecture to address this problem.  The architecture is built on Data Distribution Service (DDS) – an infrastructure designed for real-time systems. RTI’s approach will provide support for Quality-of-service (QoS)-enabled messaging message-exchange patterns (e.g. publish-subscribe and request-reply) and other mediation functions such as transformation routing aggregation splitting and filtering. RTI’s approach supports real-time dissemination of track updates and reliable delivery of fires and effects messages.

Verocel the leading provider of expertise and services for Software Verification will provide tools and expertise to ensure that we build a certifiable design.  Wind River Systems the leading real-time operating system vendor will ensure that our design works with separation kernels.  Boeing Northrop Grumman and Raytheon will ensure practical application.  This team will deliver a quality certifiable architecture that works on real UAVs.  This proposal will enable new UAV mission capabilities at affordable cost.  BENEFIT:  RTI was founded on the premise of successfully commercializing advanced research.  RTI enjoys a 100th Percentile DoD SBIR Commercialization Achievement Index (CAI) placing it in the top 1% of companies receiving SBIR funding.  Our basic strategy has two facets: (a)  Providing research to AFRL will further the overall UAV flight control community’s effort to speed the adoption mixed-criticality technologies thereby increasing general market demand for RTI products and services.   (b) This research also will help in the certification and acceptance of our own “RTI Data Distribution Service Safety Critical Edition” product offering. RTI Data Distribution Service Safety-Critical Edition has been designed to the rigorous standards for safety certification but is not yet certifiable. The overall market for this technology is emerging. To date several commercial vendors are supplying pieces of the overall solution.  We see our domain expertise product performance and customer support as primary differentiators between our potential competitors and us. We expect the proposed work done for this mixed-criticality SBIR effort will have applicability to both commercial and government unmanned system customers.  Our architecture will let developers assemble precertified distributed components on an advanced UAV. It will support mixed-critical components and information flow enforcing tightly controlled interactions. The final system will enable lower cost lower power smaller UAV designs that can execute complex missions. Most importantly it will enable piecewise certification without requiring recertification of the entire UAV. This mixed-criticality distributed architecture will transform UAV designs.","F093-005-0486","AF093-005","09.3",

Automatic detection identification and classification of such systems is desired to ease operator workload in dense signal environments. The employment of a Feature Extraction Pre-Processor can be used to enhance a host Electronic Surveillance System's Emitter Track and ID capabilities using observable intentional modulation on pulse (IMOP) unintentional modulation on pulse (UMOP) features.

Several approaches to detect and estimate the signal instantaneous modulation bandwidth are considered to enable signals to be dynamically allocated to digital measurement receivers with sub-band tuning bandwidth sample rate and demodulation parameters specified.  One potential approach uses a polyphase implementation with multiple channelization stages and arbitration.  A second employs entropy based detection processes to localize signal extent.  The third employing dyadic Wavelet decomposition to channelize in a structured fashion is included for its potential efficiency in covering large time-frequency signal space while providing finer grain bins in either time or frequency to address narrow pulses and narrowband signals respectively.   A final approach the Fractional Fourier Transform(FrFT)  is considered for its potential to detect and characterize signals in a maximally compact fractional domain.  Previous MATLAB and FPGA code for feature extraction polyphase channelizer  entropy-based signal detection and FrFT are leveraged.  An existing digitized signal library (real world and synthetic) are proposed for testing.  The effort defines an initial implementation and assesses feasibility for use in COTS VME FPGA boards (e.g. Annapolis Microsystems WILDSTARTM 5).  BENEFIT:  Key benefits and findings developed during this effort are applicable to any ES or ELINT application where signals must be detected and characterized rapidly.

BENEFITS: To ensure that we are providing our warfighters with the best possible weapon systems to defend the United States a great deal of effort is undertaken to maximize the lethality and in the case of a reusable weapon system like an aircraft or UAV to maximize the survivability.  Survivability has two components: susceptibility and vulnerability.  An aircraft is susceptible if an enemy weapon system can see and successfully cause the weapon system to interact with the aircraft in a detrimental manner.  An aircraft is vulnerable if the successful weapon system interaction can cause the aircraft to abort its mission or prevent it from returning to base.  To maximize the ability of an aircraft to complete its mission or return to base every new or modified aircraft must go through some process of survivability or live fire testing.  This process involves determining the actual effects of weapon systems likely to be used against the aircraft and changing the system to negate those effects.  This process includes testing physics based structural/dynamic simulation as well as functional simulation using empirical models.  In order to ensure that our troops have the safest most survivable and most lethal weapon systems available to them we must ensure that we get the most out of the testing and simulations that we perform.  The simulations and testing need to have all of the rigor our warfighters deserve and run in time frame that delivers the systems they need when they need them.       RHAMM Technologies LLC. with its modeling and simulation expertise in the area of aircraft survivability is well positioned to fully develop the capability to achieve realistic blast pressures in a completely Lagrangian simulation.  We will do this by extending the ACE-like LS-DYNA user defined load we''''ve developed previously to include blast reflections and shadows.        At the completion of Phase II RHAMM Technologies LLC will have developed and demonstrated software that will allow realistic blast pressures in a completely Lagrangian LS-DYNA simulation.  This software will be offered to LSTC through lease or sale to be included in LS-DYNA or sold as a standalone package for use by other LS-DYNA analysts looking at the effects of non-spherical blasts on structures.  The intellectual capital that will be amassed through the completion of this work will also be used by RHAMM to obtain and complete additional contracts of a related nature.","F083-249-0036","AF083-249","08.3",

The ability to detect impending failures in complex electronics systems supports condition-based maintenance (CBM) programs to reduce maintenance costs and increase operational readiness of advanced EW systems.  The innovative method detects degradation in digital systems such as those used in EW systems by using an advanced power draw correlation technique which uses a non-intrusive pseudo-random sequence (PRS) of digital bits and comparing that input to the resulting ordinary digital noise on the input power bus of a digital-based system. If the digital system is operating within its specifications there will be a high-correlation between the input PRS sequence and the power supply noise; but if the digital system is degraded the degree of correlation is reduced with the degree of non-correlation increasing as degradation increases.  The completed SBIR Phase II program will include a test bed to demonstrate a prototype suitable for use in a laboratory environment. This prototype will be an excellent platform for subsequent evaluation testing and integration to a specific EW system platform.   BENEFIT:  The proposed power draw correlation technique (PDCT) will provide a valuable tool for reducing maintenance costs and increasing operational readiness of digital-based electronic systems such as an EW system.  Because digital-based electronic systems include a wide range of systems such as communications equipment digital data servers processors and digital transmission systems the power draw correlation technique has a correspondingly wide range of commercial applications – especially in aerospace-based applications. The proposed innovation has the potential to provide both commercial and government unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) an advanced level of aircraft critical component and system health visibility with the real-time knowledge of components’ remaining useful life.

In Phase I Ridgetop will develop and deliver the design of an ART systems including: - Mapping the fault tree into a reasoning-based troubleshooting algorithm  - Interpretation of the component interactions through hierarchical spatial and temporal information - Reduction of uncertainty with in-situ measurement  - Design of an easy-to-use tool including a user-interface and autonomic capability - Validation of the algorithm to quantify the potential benefits through appropriate metrics    BENEFIT:  For today’s complex military aircraft rigorous routine inspection and maintenance procedures are performed to ensure the health of the plane’s numerous mechanical and electronic systems. While vital this constant process has seen significant cost increases over the past 10 years as various cost components such as labor parts and aircraft downtime rise in conjunction with the increasing complexity of these systems. The proposed autonomic reasoning-based troubleshooting (ART) analysis model can drastically reduce these costs via the rapid identification of faults and failures which typically take significant amounts of time to repair. In addition Ridgetop’s innovation will provide an intelligent user-friendly interface supplying not only the visual diagnosis but an optimal action plan and rationale to correct the issue as well. Specifically designed for aircraft such as the C-130 and F-15 the innovation can also be applied to the ECSS F-35 NASA NextGen Shuttles UAV’s commercial aircraft and commercial automotive applications.","F093-208-0503","AF093-208","09.3",

This will allow existing SATA SSD RAID systems to transfer data to a storage system in a fraction of the time required to write the data over the SATA interface. This will be very useful in systems using a RAID array of SATA SSD drives during live missions where the data needs to be efficiently transferred to backend systems at the conclusion of a mission.     RNET will develop and fabricate the ruggedized multi-ported SSD board and the associated software to enable efficient data transfer. The SSD board will contain high-throughput SSD controllers multiple NAND memory devices a RAID controller to parallelize data access and a processing element (e.g. FPGA CPU Microcontroller) to provide “host mode” to enable post-mission data transfer. The board will also contain a standard SATA interface and a high-throughput data interface. During runtime the interface will be chosen automatically enabling the SATA interface when the system is being used for data capture and the high-throughput interface to automatically copy data from the device.    BENEFIT:  The product will find extensive use in the DoD surveillance platforms and hence our plan is to transition the product to DoD Primes. We have made initial contacts with some of the Primes who have provided a strong letter of support.

Whereas physical image sensors derive information by high density Nyquist sampling over 99.99% of the visual field human vision uses visual information derived by low density variance sampling. The initial bio-inspired development is a practical demonstration of three autonomous system recognition tasks that will be performed much more effectively using variance instead of Nyquist information. This information is easily derived by variance sub-sampling the output of any conventional image sensor. A subsequent bio-inspired development would be to implement this (very simple) sub-sampling operation directly on the focal plane of the image sensor just as is done in the human retina.

Adding to the challenge the flight dynamics and operational environment of medium / high altitude platforms limit the availability and precision of traditional non-GPS positioning systems. Sun sensors and star-trackers lack the needed precision while dense clouds and lack of features over flat terrain render ground-image referencing systems inadequate. To address this navigation challenge for transonic through hypersonic weapon systems and UAVs SA Photonics proposes development of a highly stable ultra sensitive inertial measurement unit 100X more stable and sensitive than existing navigation sensors. Our IMU enables 3 meter accuracy with very low update frequency with updates originating from a sparsely populated network of ground based reference stations.  BENEFIT:  Existing inertial navigation systems are capable of 0.5 to 1.0 nautical miles per hour positioning error and are relatively expensive as they are based on fiber optic gyros or ring laser gyros. Other MEMs gyro based INS are smaller and compact but have 20 to 100X worse performance and rely even more so on GPS than the fiber gyro and RLG INS’s.  SA Photonics proposed solution improves inertial sensor performance up to 100X over high performance INSs today and uses technology that is more compatible with the need for lower cost and smaller packages required by smaller unmanned air vehicles.

This is primarily due to the rate drift that is inherent across all gyro technologies. Fiber Optic Gyros offer excellent drift and sensitivity performance with up to 1000 times better bias stability than the best MEMs gyros and have practically no G-sensitive bias. However until now high performance FOGs were very large expensive and consumed significant power as they must precisely control their fiber-coil temperatures. Such devices are not practical for use on smaller antenna pedestals. SA Photonics has developed key FOG technologies that enable the development of small high performance gyroscopes that do not require costly temperature stabilization systems. To address the Air Force’s requirement for highly stable attitude determination of antenna pedestals SA Photonics is pleased propose the Phase II development of small low power highly stable  3-axis FOG. This FOG will enable highly stable and accurate pedestal pointing over extended periods without additional sensor systems or external signals such as GPS to correct for gyro bias drift.

BENEFIT:  SA Photonics will use technical solutions developed at SA Photonics to produce a standalone low cost high stability navigation-grade Fiber Optic Gyro (FOG) for both defense and commercial applications. For defense applications these systems can be used for measuring the rotation of antenna pedestal platforms for Missile interceptor programs such as THAAD Multiple Kill Vehicle and Kinetic Energy Interceptor and for ground vehicle navigation UAV navigation and control shipboard applications. For commercial applications these systems can be used for commercial and private aircraft and ship navigation. With these technologies the FOG will have the following performance:   • High Stability: Angular stability < 1° 3&#61555; in 24 hours • Wide Temperature Range: -50°C to 85°C • High Angular Rate: > 100°/sec • Low cost relative to other gyros with similar performance ","F093-140-0471","AF093-140","09.3",

The proposed system is based on fundamental principles of neurobiological systems i.e. it incorporates mathematical models and system architectures designed to mimic how the brain recognizes sounds from the outside world.  The proposed system also will precisely localize the source of sounds of interest and direct secondary response devices toward that source.  The proposed system is an extension of a recently commercialized gunshot recognition and localization system called SENTRI I currently being sold in Chicago Illinois Tijuana Mexico and other US cities.  The SENTRI I however is designed only to detect and recognize short-duration gunshots and is not capable of analyzing and recognizing other security breaching noises such as RPGs and mortars vehicle engines human voices etc.  Re-design of this proven system are proposed to extend applicability to recognition and localization of a wider range of security-relevant noises add new microphone technology to substantially extend the "listening range" and reduce the system footprint to a field-deployable size.BENEFITS: Development of adaptive intelligent acoustic recognition/alert systems for security breaching noise detection threat identification and perimeter protection using Safety Dynamics' core technology the Dynamic Synapse Neural Network (DSNN).  The DSNN technology has been optimized and is currently commercialized for gunshot recognition as the SENTRI (Smart Sensor Enabled Neural Threat Recognition and Identification) a system that recognizes gunshots sends range and bearing details to cameras which can then rotate and pan in on the source of the incident.  The SENTRI is integrated with wireless communications and a weather resistant box mounted on telephone or power poles for urban crime prevention.  This STTR will extend Safety Dynamics' acoustic recognition technology to non-gunshot events critical to security breaching noises.  ","N064-036-0292","N06-T036","06  ",

The mission design and the aircraft operating system have high levels of artificial intelligence and expert systems that can make "decisions" in the event of contingencies during the actual mission.  Human operators will monitor and if needed intervene.  To do this they will need to be able to get inside the "mind" of the vehicle to determine what is going on and establish situational awareness.  Sapien Systems will integrate a display panorama with a variety of technologies including: speech recognition speech synthesis and natural language parsing.  The system will allow the operator to interact with the system in a more natural manner via natural language queries and the system will respond graphically and verbally using a set of agents assigned to different tasks during the mission. The anticipated benefits of this system will be rapid understanding by the human operator of the autonomous systems actions and intentions. The human can then decide to intervene if necessary. Autonomous aircraft are already active in battlefield situations and there is anticipated a need for hundreds more of them with highly sophisticated mission activities. The workstation design will allow personnel in multiple levels of command rapid understanding of the flight situations. Autonomous systems are ubiquitous on the Internet and there will be more autonomous vehicles. For example with the advent of "Smart Highways" artificial intelligence will not only drive individual vehicles but also will supervise traffic flow over hundreds or thousands of vehicles. The need for display systems for such complex activities that will allow human operators to rapidly understand what the systems are doing.

The ISG magnetic structure is innovative and anticipated to demonstrate excellent control of ISG side-loading thus managing radial bearing requirements low weight and significant radial suspension capability. SatCon's experience in high temperature high speed and fault tolerant magnetic bearings will be applied to design of combination magnetic/foil bearings to complete the rotor support system. In Phase II a complete full scale inline prototype demonstration is planned.  Multiple paths (long- mid- and near -term) to commercializing the results of the program are clear. A long-term application is in support of the VAATE initiative which will carry on from the IHPTET More Electric Engine Initiative. The SatCon ISG and combination oil-free bearings could be applied to advanced versions of large (turbofan) engines small (turboshaft and turboprop) engines and expendable (cruise missile or UAV) engines. Such a solution is primarily targeted at next generation UAV/UCAV applications that will require oil-free bearing systems with thrust loads up to 5000 lbf for non-expendable first day/first strike missions. The IHPTET Phase III Advanced Concepts demonstrators (ATEGG JTAGG and JTDE) and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programs will likely provide the basis for the next generation of commercial and military transport aircraft engine which will be a More Electric Engine where the oil-free bearing and ISG components could be employed as part of the rotor support and electric power systems.  In a mid-term time frame SatCon sees a clear application for the technology in advanced-concept Auxiliary Power Unit and industrial stationary gas-turbine-driven power generation applications. In the near term some of the innovations in the ISG design will be incorporated by SatCon Power Systems business unit to expand the existing product line and possibly to provide cost reduction for the existing product by elimination of a set of costly permanent magnets.

A control system is proposed that utilizes durable fins that are deployed and controlled using low-mass solid-state high-speed piezoceramic actuators. The high piezoceramic electrical to mechanical efficiency permits enhanced aerodynamic flight control in a significantly reduced package size and greatly reduced mass. Novel lightweight high-strength materials are available that provide the stiffness and stability to the fins and permit it to withstand the high temperature aerothermal environment. The low mass of the fin coupled with the strength of the actuator permits it to rapidly deploy and retract allowing the vehicle to more quickly respond to commanded maneuvers. The only massive component of the system is the battery to supply the power to actuate the fins and the battery can be placed in any convenient location within the vehicle. The successful completion of this proposed effort will demonstrate that the piezoceramic flight control system (PFCS) can meet the broad needs of future BMDO systems especially for THAAD and AIT type interceptors. This proposal outlines an investigation into the integration of piezoceramic adaptive aerodynamic structures technology with novel lightweight materials (ceramics carbon nanofoam expanded metal foams and/or diamond-like coatings) to create a launch hardened flight control system that can meet the broad needs of future BMDO systems especially for THAAD and AIT type interceptors. The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) has a continuing need for advanced propulsion technologies components and systems that can significantly enhance the capability of ballistic missile defense systems to respond to threats while increasing operational flexibility and reducing costs. Of particular interest is advances in divert and sustained maneuver capabilities required for high acceleration low-mass or miniature interceptors proposed for both NMD and especially TMD applications. The PFCS capitalizes on miniaturization and integration to produce significant reductions in the overall vehicle mass permitting more substantial diverts and more agile maneuvering. These attributes are of value in other military aviation systems such as small-scale smart munitions UAVs and remote sensing platforms. The PFCS technology is applicable to several Department of Defense (DoD) Key Technology areas such as Air Platforms (high-speed propulsion) Material/Processes (materials for survivability affordability and environmental quality) Space Platforms (launch vehicles) and Weapons. The military and aerospace industry has potential uses for the lightweight ceramics as large-scale optics and mirrors and as lightweight insulation for the high-speed aerothermal flight regime. These markets will be explored through the establishment of close business relationships with many of the current aerospace contractors and suppliers. There is considerable potential for use of piezoelectric actuators in military aerospace and commercial systems as position sensors and fine-scale position motors in scanning systems ultra-high resolution photolithography systems precision manufacturing and specifically precision machining especially where active vibration damping and real-time adjustment is desired. This market continues to expand and commercial partners exists if a specific application developed for the military market should show promise to transition to a commercial product.","B021-0593","BMDO02-006","02.1",

To facilitate development and eventual transfer of the Autonomous Pilot to actual UAV hardware SARA proposes a modular control architecture.  Our proposed “Autonomous Pilot- Multi-Objective Deconfliction” (APMOD) system  is based on the “Mission Oriented Operating Suite” (MOOS) architecture.  The modularity allows simulation modules during the development phase to be replaced with hardware integration modules as the program develops into hardware-in-the-loop solutions and eventually into actual UAV platforms.","F073-089-0685","AF073-089","07.3",

SRC therefore proposes to develop an innovative compression technique based on the wavelet packet transform that will dynamically adapt to the SAR data source statistical distribution.  Our emphasis will be on researching suitable cost metrics and search algorithms yielding compression results that support automated exploitation and human interpretability.Compression of SAR image data using lossy Block Adaptive Quantization (BAQ) or lossless techniques does not provide the degree of reduction needed to transmit over commonly available wireless link bandwidths (e.g. T-1 = 1.544 Megabits per second).  Our compression technology will overcome this wireless bottleneck with suitable compression ratios providing benefit to a variety of SAR applications including oil spill monitoring sea ice monitoring agricultural classification and assessment natural resource location oceanography topographical mapping search and rescue operations treaty verification and non-proliferation monitoring.","F011-0970","AF01-204","01.1",

The approach is based on the discrete adjoint which will be derived and implemented on a software component basis with the various multidisciplinary software components being linked together through a Python interface thus preserving modularity and enabling the application of the adjoint approach to legacy disciplinary solvers.  For the Phase 1 project the emphasis will be on non-linear time-dependent aeroelastic problems and the adjoint derived sensitivities will be used to drive a flutter optimization problem.  The approach will be fully verifiable to machine precision by including a scripted complex variable verification capability. The overall approach is designed to be extendable in Phase 2 to more complex multidisciplinary problems involving additional disciplines such as aerothermodynamics and to provide an eventual path forward towards higher order sensitivity methods for use in optimization and/or uncertainty quantification.  BENEFIT:  The extension of adjoint methods to time-dependent multidisciplinary problems will enable new capabilities in computational aerospace engineering. Aeroelastic optimization through optimal selection of structural parameters and tradeoffs between aerodynamic performance and structural rigidity will be enabled.  This will be of immediate use to government programs involved in the design of conventional fixed wing aircraft rotorcraft high altitude UAVs and other non-conventional configurations. Commercial applications include the development of design tools for fixed and rotary wing commercial aircraft that combine in a unified manner both structural and aerodynamic design considerations.","F11B-T06-0113","AF11-BT06","11.B",

Flight critical systems are often designed with redundancy since failure could prove catastrophic. However the size weight and power constraints preclude all systems from being redundant. Mixed-criticality UAV systems benefit from software components which can evaluate the likelihood that the non-redundant systems are functioning properly. We propose to develop VERIFY Evaluation of non-Redundant Information in Flight Systems (VERIFY) which produces confidence measures and warnings for non-redundant data sources with no means to directly determine when the data has been degraded.     For Phase I we will apply VERIFY methods to height-above-ground rangefinder sensing. VERIFY begins with statistical hypothesis testing developing statistical models from data and assuring that observed trends continue. The secondary level fuses data from critical system states and the mission definition (which both can are assumed accurate) to observe data correlation yielding higher fidelity confidence measures. The highest tier which could be implemented for some missions (and in future Phases) closes the loop with VERIFY and the critical systems to allow system excitation for failure detection and identification.  BENEFIT:  The benefits of a modular integrity management system such as VERIFY are tremendous since unmanned systems are taking a greater role in Air Force and military mission plans. Autonomous systems such as UAVs USVs and UGVs will likely utilize new data sources that are mission critical and they must be capable of decision-making self-determination and self-assessment. For non-redundant systems the ramifications of degraded performance or failure do not justify the additional weight or design cost in increasing the subsystem redundancy and robustness. Autonomous systems could use VERIFY to determine the failure status of non-redundant data systems and integrate them to highly critical and redundant flight control systems.

Continuing development integration implementation and extensive simulation and hardware testing of the VERIFY system will result in a comprehensive software-based FDIA system which also predicts sensor degradation trends and generates associated confidence measures.  BENEFIT:  This project will result in the development implementation and testing of a software module which provides integrity management for single-thread sensors. The modularity of the software architecture allows the user to apply the developed algorithms to different sensor types. The applications of such a modular integrity management system are tremendous since unmanned systems are taking a greater role in long-term planning in Air Force and other DoD branches.

In addition the potency of the ATR algorithm in the extraction of feature information from the data is of importance.  In order to maintain a high vehicle to operator ratio in ISR systems a key criterion is the false alarm rate. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves relate the probability of detection of a target to the probability of a false alarm. The position on the ROC curve is a function of response bias which is directly related to the threshold set in the ATR detectors. The goal of this proposal is to develop a methodology for performance prediction and modeling of operator in the loop ATR systems. The proposed SUMATRA system (Supervised Modeling of ATR Algorithms) will relate physics and geometry-based vectors to false alarm rates.  BENEFIT:   In order to maintain a high vehicle to operator ratio in ISR systems a key criterion is the false alarm rate. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves relate the probability of detection of a target to the probability of a false alarm. The position on the ROC curve is a function of response bias which is directly related to the threshold set in the ATR detectors. One way of achieving a lower false alarm rate is to lower the threshold. This shifts the operating point and lowers the false alarm rate but it comes at the expense of a concomitant lower probability of detection. Of course this is undesirable. A better option would be to move to another curve instead which can reduce the false alarm rate without the associated drop in probability of detection.  In order to achieve this performance modeling of ATR algorithms which can include the operator in the loop is critical. The proposed SUMATRA system will model the performance of ATR algorithms and therefore be a vary valuable tool for the Air Force. I addition civil use in security systems such as airports public transportation and even closed video surveillance is anticipated.","F083-180-2052","AF083-180","08.3",

Success depends on EW sensor and communications systems detecting enemy radars and communications before they detect us.  EW sensor systems themselves may suffer UAV losses jamming and other interference.  Large traffic bursts from simultaneous detections may lead to congestion lost detection reports and detection delay.  SSCI will apply innovative network techniques to provide routing that automatically generates multi-path routes when they are needed and useful to keep track of more network state information so routes will minimize exposure to enemy interference and Disruption Tolerant Networking techniques to avoid discards during short outages and increase detection information delivery.  We also provide network organization techniques to optimize detection information delivery to fusion nodes that can combine them to detect enemy emitters and methods for fast detection of congestion or link loss to trigger re-routing.  Our methods are distributed adaptive and efficient - providing redundancy when necessary to preserve performance.  Our partner is BBN Technologies the principle developer of the original ARPANET.  Their expertise in routing and network development combined with SSCI's background in mobile DTN networking data fusion and EW geolocation methods will ensure successful Phase II algorithm development and Phase III transition.  BENEFIT:  EW Battle Management systems work in hostile environments – with enemy interference node loss and intermittent communications.  The routing and network organization methods here meet time reliability and robustness requirements by providing distributed adaptive methods to designate alternate sensors and fusion nodes for task completion to generate alternate routes to get detection information where it is needed and to control bandwidth expenditures to maximize system potential in all environments. Alternate tasking and routing paths ensure detections when parts of the sensor or communications network is disabled by the enemy; adaptive methods that use resources only when necessary preserve system capacity to detect new enemy threats.  The communications protocols developed here may be included in UAV systems such as Global Hawk.  EW sensor networks with the features developed in this project may ultimately support the Joint Strike Fighter program. Our methods are applicable to Homeland Defense sensor networks and commercial or personal applications where sensors are vulnerable to suppression or environmental degradation.","F2-6356","AF103-189","10.3",

Such  missions call for unprecedented levels of autonomy reliability precision and fault tolerance  over long periods of time especially for missions with communication blackouts. The  complexity of the design process for autonomous fault tolerant control of such multi-levels  requires  hierarchical supervisory controllers of a hybrid type where low level systems  involve continuous dynamics and the higher levels involve discrete actions.  In this STTR effort Scientific Systems Company (SSC) in  collaboration with Univ. of California Berkeley addresses the problem of systematic design  testing and verification of Intelligent Supervisory Control Architectures for Health Monitoring and  Realtime Reconfigurable Control for multiple UCAV missions. We will investigate theoretical  and design issues involved in the choice of system architecture and methods for interfacing  elements of the resulting hybrid system. To incorporate fault tolerance a novel failure  detection identification and reconfiguration (FDIR) approach using the combined  techniques of Interacting Multiple Model-Extended Kalman Filters(IMM-EKF) and adaptive  Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) are proposed. This approach autonomously detects  and reconfigures the control law for suden or gradual failures of various sensors actuators  and system components.

Elimination of control surfaces results in a reduction of weight and drag as well as radar observability. Recent advances in Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) technology have rendered it a feasible alternative for unsteady flow sensing and control. This project will be performed jointly by Scientific Systems Co. and Prof. Rediniotis from Texas A&M University and will demonstrate the use of MEMS for closed-loop flow control.  In particular a delta wing is controlled by actively inducing or delaying Vortex Breakdown (VBD) so as to globally affect the flow over the wing in a desired way. The feedback mechanism is hingeless and consists of MEMS-based flow sensors and small Pneumatic Vortex Control (PVC) jet actuators. During this effort we will develop modeling and control design algorithms for active flow control. Proposed Phase I tasks include: (a) acquisition of unsteady flow data (b) control-oriented reduced order unsteady flow modeling using wavelets indicial functions and system identification techniques (c) feedback controller design and numerical evaluation using robust control techniques and (d) planning for real-time flow control demonstration in Phase II.

For UAVs this would include components such as wings fuselage and panels. To accommodate electronic functions appliqués are used with certain antennas. Cavities in wing or fuselage structures are provided to mount traditional electronic assemblies with access provided via a cover panel. The problem with this configuration is the ability to interconnect between supporting electronics and external antennas and sensors. This is one of the technical objectives the work proposed herein will address.    	The Sciperio team will address these “packaging” challenges through innovative integration of composite-based additive manufacturing and direct printing a process which is referred to as Direct Print Additive Manufacturing (DPAM). DPAM will both support the ability to co-process a multifunctional wing and serve as a post process in providing added functionality to legacy systems. The technology will be demonstrated through the fabrication of a MEMS based phase shifter which through fabrication will address the challenge areas identified in the AF121-003 solicitation.    BENEFIT:  Size weight and power (SWaP) are key benefits derived from the packaging technology developed under this SBIR. SWaP can certainly be applied to virtually all mobile platform whether military or commercial. Coupled with the drag reduction benefits in embedding the RF electronics and sensors two key application areas come to mind. First space system like satellites and satellite delivery systems would have direct benefit of SWaP and drag reduction. Space encompasses both military mission needs and the country’s new commercial space initiatives. Space habitat systems would also be a beneficiary of the structural electronics capability considering one of the largest challenges to these systems is that they are pressure vessels and ingress/egress are significant challenges. These same attributes can also be applied to underwater systems (habitat and mobile systems). These systems also have pressure issues; space equals vacuum underwater equals water pressure. Underwater systems support military missions homeland security environmental research and oil exploration.   	The consumer electronic industry generates billions of dollars in revenue annually and this technology will revolutionize next generation products. The critical component of manufacturing RF electronics in any structure will enable the future of smart phones tablets and other wireless products.  At the completion of Phase II Sciperio will deliver a specified product to Raytheon and will also establish processes to specifically address wireless electronic structures.

It's this comprehensive approach to nominating assessing selecting and actually performing simulation-based testing of potential HMD-HUD candidates that sets the ArchAngel Assessment and Testbed Approach apart from other less comprehensive approaches. As such the ArchAngel approach will result in product-sets that include: actual HMD-HUD end-technologies and a Testbed capable of supporting simulation-based acquisition-processes for HMD-HUD candidates including integration with other aviation-related weapons and weapons systems.     SDS will be apply its extensive work to date developing PC-based simulation-Testbeds to assist in selecting high-potential HMD-HUD candidates and performing simulation-based testing of those candidates early in Phase I. The ArchAngel HMD-HUD Testbed will leverage-off SDS Testbed components built for UAVs/UCAVs/Space Maneuver Vehicles/Manned Aircraft to investigate HMD-HUD symbology and techniques for transmitting information from the battlespace to the pilot.

Unfortunately long-standing problems associated with wide field-of-view visual displays for ground-based simulator-training applications--to include poor resolution poor intensity (i.e. luminosity) and high costs-have significantly affected the fielding of DMT training capabilities to date. Display resolution problems are being addressed through current Air Force efforts to develop color imaging systems with greater than 5K x 4K non-interlaced pixel resolutions at reasonable prices. The proposed Phase I Reconfigurable Frame Buffer Module (RFBM) efforts will focus on developing the interface module for driving such displays from PC-IG technology. Phase I will concentrate on interfacing to high resolution projectors which present out-the-window imagery in high-performance flight trainers as well as other display applications (e.g. DMT). The RFBM is designed to support the Air Force's capitalization of the rapidly developing PC-based graphics market to provide imagery for these systems. The RFBM is an innovative PC-based technology that will be capable of presenting 5K x 4K 60 HZ non-interlaced video. The RFBM's innovative design provides a large scalable virtual screen frame buffer that can be read and written to simultaneously by multiple parallel devices. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications for the RFBM include but are not limited to providing high resolution displays for integration with the DMT and TSTARS or other DoD and Civilian simulation training systems; DMT required capabilities such as multiple view modes multi-window multi-channel linear distortion and large area databases on the USAF M2DART A-10 UTD five channel display (4 OTW and a Maverick) F-16MTT and other DMT aircraft simulators and control stations; the support of UAV and UCAV entities in a DMT environment (i.e. AFRL contract with Dr. Martin's group for UAV/UCAV support); and DMTO&I. There are multiple classes of clients for RFBM technology and associated technologies. Government Military and Civilian aviation training customers could add initial versions of RFBM as an option on their existing aircraft simulators. Potential benefits include enhanced performance and increased standardization of maneuver training and teaching of optimal methods early to pilots. Commercial aviation could add RFBM capabilities to aircraft training simulations in their training centers after FAA certification is received. General Aviation industry including pilots of all types from initial students to those already holding private and commercial licenses could significantly benefit from the capabilities offered by RFBM. Transportation Industries in general including transports freighters and even recreational boats and race cars could also benefit.  Deployed shipboard and land versions of RFBM will perform the same general functions as the deployed aerial version. Other--SDS plans to identify numerous lucrative markets. A potential avenue which SDS plans to explore is teaming with an organization currently providing similar visual-based training services for specific markets. The following organizations appear as likely clients for the SDS RFBM system. Simulation related aerospace firms--SDS staff members have excellent contacts throughout the United States with nearly every major aerospace firm. Computer and Display Manufactures--These companies have significant interest in enhancing their feature sets and adding value to consumers for competitive purposes. RFBM type displays could be incorporated into computer displays and add HDTV configurations as an option. Entertainment--SDS's RFBM Multiple Projected HDTV Version costing less than $20K could allow the masses to learn from prerecorded scripts of experts while enjoying new and challenging approaches to their particular sport or game of choice. Educational--Universities Colleges and Schools can utilize RFBM as a training tool for teaching advanced skills of virtually any endeavor of interest.

Most ASW aircraft utilize A-size (4.875”D x 36”L) sources.  While these A-size sources are effective the weight and volume constraints of the MH-60R helicopter UAV platforms along with the littoral ASW threat of quiet diesel-electric submarines in noisy environments require an aggressive approach to miniaturizing sensors to allow for the deployment of denser fields. The requirement is to carry a greater number of sensors enabling adequate field performance in spite of inevitably short detection ranges for passive and active vulnerabilities.  The following potential areas of technology development have been identified: • Miniaturization of the decelerator and floatation functionality  • Miniaturization of payload chemistry deployment and initiation methodology  • Miniaturization of the transmitter/receiver to fit in the MJU-10 form factor. • Miniaturization of the power source technology   PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL/DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS:  The small size low cost and standardized form factor will enable use of these sensors for marine mammal surveys commercial harbor defense and drug interdiction of high speed drug smuggling vessels. BENEFITS: The miniature acoustic sensor being dweveloped here will provide dramatic weight reductions tha will simplify deployment and logistics operations in support of the Navy's planned dense field multi-static ASW missions.

Seashell proposes to design fabricate and characterize an anti-ice system based on an electrothermal system that will be light weight low power and able to be retrofitted to existing RPA. Seashell will meet the weight power and retrofitting criteria by utilizing a high performance heating element and Seashell’s proprietary icephobic coating. The enhanced heating element will provide superior thermal conductivity and mechanical properties while lowering the overall film weight when compared to existing technology. The icephobic coating will make the system more robust to environmental icing conditions and lower the power consumption by making the removal of ice and water from the surface more efficient. The system will be tested over a wide range of icing conditions to ensure anti-icing performance.  BENEFIT:  As the use of remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) continues to grow the need for an anti icing system to extend the environmental conditions in which they operate is becoming increasingly important. The lack of anti-icing equipment on RPAs limits the use of these aircraft to when specific environmental conditions are met that minimize icing risk. These environmental launch specifications cause unwanted delays and expense due to grounded aircraft and may have severe consequences for critical missions. Designing an anti-ice system that can be retrofitted to an existing RPA will eliminate environmental launch requirements and provide both economic and productivity improvements to the military and commercial RPA users.    Outside of military use the anti-ice system will be applicable for use on small planes. Most small planes in use today do not have an anti-ice system installed limiting their use to environmental conditions where icing is not a concern. Seashell’s proposed anti-ice system will be superior to other anti-ice systems on the market by providing a solution that is more robust to icing lower weight more environmentally friendly (no glycol fluids) and without extensive modification for retrofitting to the aircraft. The proposed anti-ice system will also be applicable for other non-aerospace applications (e.g. wind turbines communication towers radomes etc.)","F121-114-0430","AF121-114","12.1",

This will be the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM).  It will  provide an unprecedented capability to the commander to know with  confidence the effect of his strike mission.  Housed in a small cylinder  are a parachute battery sensor suite sensor processor transmitter  and antenna.  These are deployed as the TLAM begins its final attack.  After ejection the parachute holds the sensor suite aloft long enough  to make before--and--after observations of the target area.  These are  analyzed by the sensor processor and the results are transmitted to a  satellite and thence to the commander.  Once the BDRS lands it  continues to report thus providing additional intelligence.  Future  growth to a powered system to replace the parachute is described.    The multi-sensor suite is selected to be synergetic with the strength  of one sensor complementing the weakness of another.  This will ensure  maximum performance in a small expendable package.  The BDRS design  described here will support the TLAM but can be modified to serve a  number of other military weapons systems. There is a critical requirement for battle damage assessment for all  branches of the military services.    Bomb Damage Assessment          Bomb damage assessment (BDA) determines whether or not the  objective of a strike mission has been met.            This is undertaken not merely to satisfy a commander's curiosity  about what damage has been inflicted upon an enemy. The information  collected through a successful BDA effort provides a military commander  not only with a critical measure of the effectiveness of his or her  forces but it is also required for the commander to decide whether or  not it is necessary to strike a target a second time. If a restrike is  not needed forces avoid unnecessary risks and a military commander  makes the most efficient use of assets.            There are a variety of technologies that promise better ways of  performing BDA. Some exist or will exist in certain weapons that  provide in essence instant BDA by transmitting live pictures of the  targets they are striking such as  the future Tactical Tomahawk or the  Stand-off Land Attack Missile - Extended Range (SLAM-ER). Other imagery  that is useful for performing BDA is video imagery provided during  laser-guided bomb engagements.            Another technology that offers the promise of improved BDA is  the unmanned air vehicle (UAV). Work remains before it is decisively  proven that such craft can effectively shoulder the BDA mission. It does  not seem likely that a UAV will be capable of accompanying a Tomahawk  mission so it probably is moot for our purposes.  Until then the bulk  of BDA will still be performed by manned reconnaissance systems for the  foreseeable future.            There are three general classes of targets that require timely  and assured BDA.  First are targets associated with weapons of mass  destruction whose destruction must be guaranteed. Second are high-value  targets whose destruction must clearly be accounted for before moving  into an operation's next stages.  Third there are select targets of  special military diplomatic or media interest to the National Command  Authority.            "Near real-time BDA is considered very important as a  weapon/force multiplier. The National Command Authority's  increasing  desire to 'calibrate' strike operations and the need to fight the public  perception war on CNN makes this arguably the most important capability  on the list" --Naval Strike Forum member.        The Battle Damage Reporting System can be adapted to provide  real-time BDA for a variety of weapons systems from missiles to  artillery and naval guns.  Its ability to travel with the mission  provides a unique capability to be at the exact location needed at the  time the strike takes place.","N012-0109","N01-149","01.2",

The second idea is an integrated sensor-in-the-loop target ID hypothesis-testing capability that will adaptively task all of the radar sensors and front end processing engines.  The proposed Phase 1 effort will perform trade studies to determine an effective architecture for performing wide area search and ID and the integration of this sensor and a network of small UAV borne sensors.

In Phase 2 we intend to modify our existing E-Series radar to demonstrate concurrent GMTI and HRR modes to track and ID a moving target and determine when it stops to form low and high resolution SAR images of the stopped target  and to redetect and track the target when it moves.

The design focuses on the underlying mathematical modeling to tightly couple video measurements to INS navigation parameters automatically extract feature depth within this tight coupling and automate the addition and dropping of features necessary to perform long term video/IMU navigation without reliance on external sources. SET will seek to productize the technology and make it available for use on US Air Force and other aircraft to enable precision navigation without GPS. ","F064-032-0292","AF06-T032","06  ",

When GPS is denied INS measurements drift to a point where they are no longer useful for navigation and flight control. During Phase I the SET/AFIT team has demonstrated a successful design and implementation for high accuracy navigation from optical IMU coupling to correct IMU drift. Multiple orders of magnitude enhancement in navigation accuracy was demonstrated for both consumer and navigation grade IMU sensors. The design focuses on the underlying mathematical modeling to tightly couple video measurements to INS navigation parameters automatically extract feature depth corrections within this tight coupling and automate the addition and dropping of features necessary to perform video/IMU navigation without reliance on external correction sources. Phase II efforts will focus on the development of a fully integrated system for airborne operation based on our design for tightly coupled video/IMU navigation estimation with extensive performance evaluation.  The design has the benefit of autonomy from external aiding sources with the capability of high-accuracy independent navigation. We will extend operation of the Phase I system to produce a fully developed evaluated prototype that we will deliver and demonstrate to the Air Force.","F2-3850","AF06-T032","06  ",

The ability to cost effectively embed and integrate microelectronics will provide additional capabilities with minimal space weight and power requirements.  Additionally the ability to fabricate inexpensive sensors conformal with vehicle surfaces could greatly increase the ease of which chemical and biological agents can be detected.  This ability could have a wide range of application including homeland defense. This technology also has potential in the commercial sector for a embedded sensors logic and communications systems where cost space weight and power are constrained.","D031-0188","SB031-019","03.1",

(SI2) proposes to develop an embedded state sensing system for adaptive multifunctional air vehicle structures to enable fly-by-feel or intelligent control.  The embedded sensor system will: (1) be capable of actively sensing a number of aerodynamic and structural performance dynamics encountered by the aircraft (2) enable the efficiency of the aircraft aerodynamics and structure to be maximized throughout the flight envelope and (3) permit fly-by-feel technologies through the combination of locally processed sensor data and reactive and predictive control algorithms.  SI2 will use its proprietary System Integrated Design and Manufacturing (SIDM) technology (which utilizes patented Laser Transfer and Direct Write fabrication techniques) to design and integrate the sensor system directly with the platform’s airframe.  SI2’s prior experience in developing structurally integrated electronic systems for air platforms will be utilized to develop a lightweight robust network of embedded state sensors.    BENEFIT:   SI2’s approach to developing a structurally integrated sensor system for adaptive multifunctional air vehicle structures minimizes the space weight power and cost burden of implementing “smart structures”.  Both structural functionality and aerodynamic efficiency are improved without compromising asset performance (e.g. endurance).  Increased structural functionality reduces the need for large safety factors and permits the aircraft to fully exploit the physical limits of airframe and while increasing the flight envelope.  Additional aerodynamic efficiency permits increased range and payload while decreasing the stresses on the airframe.  This is important for a wide range of aircraft from small unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) to high altitude long endurance (HALE) aircraft such as the Air Force’s Global Hawk.  Hence the technology may also be extended to commercial aircraft where it may be utilized to increase fuel efficiency which has significant market impact.","F083-178-1440","AF083-178","08.3",

The HFI system consist of a wide field of view sensor head that employs small multi-spectral imagers in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) with the spectral bands selected specifically for detection of small arms fire (SAF) mortars rocket-propelled grenades (RPG’s) and man-portable missiles (MANPADS).  The system will feature innovative extensions of recently-developed HFI capabilities and incorporate new focal plane array technologies to extend the spectral band pass in the SWIR for the RPA application.  The spectral imaging system will capitalize on existing algorithm strategies for SAF as well as exploiting spectral-temporal data already obtained by SSSC in order to model and design the system to classify energetic events based on their spectral temporal and spatial profiles.  The entire system will be uncooled and occupy a small size weight and power envelope without a refrigerator.  The development of this sensor represents a unique opportunity in the development of advanced aircraft survivability equipment.  BENEFIT:  The new sensor combines staring imaging technology miniature spectral imaging technology recent developments in digital signal processing and focal plane array technology and commercially available products to produce an innovative multispectral imaging system.  The ability of the new sensor to rapidly acquire temporally and spatially co-registered spectral data in the extended SWIR will provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate algorithms for real-time event detection and classification based on spatial spectral and temporal signatures.  In addition the small physical size of the sensor will demonstrate the possibility of portable spectral imaging as well as the ability to integrate onto helicopter UAV and other airborne platforms.  Finally the sensor will demonstrate the ability to replace multiple stand-alone systems with a single integrated sensor saving size weight power inefficiency and cost.  Specific applications for the proposed sensor include specific reconnaissance and cueing for RPA applications as well as self-protection for pilots and crew of rotorcraft from a broad spectrum of threats including guided missiles unguided rockets anti-aircraft artillery and small arms fire.  By combining sensor data with onboard navigation data the sensor can provide real-time situational awareness intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance for other air and ground crew in the vicinity.  Other potential applications of the spectral imaging technology for defense purposes include real-time bomb damage assessment airborne and distant target tracking and remote chemical analysis of engine exhaust.  In addition we anticipate possible applications in law enforcement homeland defense industrial process monitoring medical diagnostics and medical imaging.  ","F121-102-1640","AF121-102","12.1",

The challenge of this SIBIR has been to meet the 25-lb weight goal within performance and cost constraints. The 25-lb system will identify men from 15 km and trucks from 45 km.  Sonoma Design Group LLC has designed an ultra-light weight low cost long stand-off reconnaissance system for use on a variety of small vehicles.  This breakthrough product despite its small size and light weight provides performance twice Predator's in daylight and near Predator's at night. This system provides outstanding performance to small fixed and rotary winged UAVs and manned systems as well as the hovercraft platforms originally targeted.  There is no substitute for focal length and stability is the key to using it effectively. The gimbal design is extremely stable forming a perfect platform for the long focal length small field of view (FOV) system. The gimbal stabilizes to 5 microradian RMS. This is a performance level far better than ever previously achieved in this class gimbal system and which allows the extremely long telephoto 1250mm lens to be effective. BENEFITS:  manned aircraft and small lifting bodies or swaying structures. This system has applications by the Marines for supporting expeditionary warfare operations by the Army for cavalry and scout units by the Navy for small UAVs and by special security forces deployed overseas. Other applications include border and coast patrol wildlife and fishery protection traffic management and drug interdiction. In particular the very high resolution of the visible TV allows reading European license plates at ranges up to 2 km.","","SB981-006","98.1",

Space Computer Corporation proposes to develop and demonstrate a methodology for joint exploitation and fusion of minefield discriminants available from multiple image observables or features and also from multiple wavebands or sensors.  Phase I will emphasize the use of existing multi-band MidWave Infrared (MWIR) and LWIR sensor data with a proven algorithm fusion technique to exploit spatial and spectral detection features within each individual waveband.  SCC will apply band-to-band registration methods to the MWIR sensor data so that it may be fully exploited for automated minefield detection.   This effort will use an extensive set of processing tools and techniques developed under DARPA funding for exploiting multispectral and multi-sensor image data.  The Phase I Option will extend this concept by cross-registration of MWIR and LWIR sensor imagery to enable joint fusion of discrimination features between multiple sensors.  In Phase II this general fusion framework could be expanded to accommodate other maturing sensor technologies for mine detection including scanned lasers pulse compression lasers (LADARs) and hyperspectral sensors operating in the reflective EO and thermal bands. The processing developed in this phase I effort as well as the proposed Phase I option will establish a methodology and framework for the application of multi-algorithm multi-sensor processing to the detection of scatterable minefields.   This will advance the state-of-the-art in automated detection of scatterable minefields using existing sensor technology.  The processing methods developed will be useful across both DoD applications for tactical demining as well as humanitarian demining efforts.   Commercial applications would include surveying previously war-torn regions for humanitarian demining purposes.  Also since many of the current and previously war-torn regions are also significant sources of natural resources we anticipate that there will be commercial interest in cost-effective surveying of regions for residual minefields.","A022-1403","A02-097","02.2",

Situations of interest include movement of vehicles material personnel and equipment as well as civilian or military vehicles.  Recent capabilities developed include the use of wide-area framing systems combined with image registration and multi-track processing to monitor moving targets.  A practical challenge encountered by such systems in a complex environment (e.g. a city) is maintaining the correct association between successive observations of the same target over long time periods or through periods of obscuration or missed coverage.  HSI sensors for tracking have the potential to improve the ability to maintain/disambiguate tracks and reacquire lost tracks.

Our approach is based on the use of the new generation of staring video hyperspectral sensors in conjunction with color cameras and/or wide-area persistent surveillance sensors for tracking.  This approach will be compared to alternative methods based on scanning sequential (temporal) filter-based approaches and Fourier transform methods against the desired system requirements.

At the same time the issues of antenna coupling and avoidance of EMI must be addressed. Given the lack of space the most viable solution is to reduce the number of antennas by increasing their functionality. Increasing functionality however requires extending the bandwidth and incorporating complex radiating structures that meet a longer list of band and gain requirements. Ideally multi-band operation will be accomplished with a concomitant reduction in size weight and profile (a conformal construct) without sacrificing optimum performance.

Reductions in force levels have made it necessary to keep available forces "out of harm's way" and the unmanned vehicle or unattended sensor offers the solution. Recent advances in technology have permitted size weight cost and volume reductions on a scale that makes the use of these devices practical. Payload assessment for cost effectiveness is critical since the likely outcome of using these devices is their ultimate destruction after relaying the collected information. Spectra Research Inc. and Veridian Engineering propose to leverage the results of an ongoing study funded by DARPA to provide a payload analysis capability to the U.S. Army. The effort will provide an assessment of the requirements for such payloads the threat to them and development of a set of analytical tools to perform the trade studies needed to determine the cost effectiveness reliability and feasibility of a given payload. The benefit to military analysts is clear the most effective payload for the mission. An "engineering toolbox" containing the necessary scripts to perform such trades clearly offers the ability to review many scenarios and understand the impact of a particular parameter on the outcome of a mission. An obvious commercial application is in the US Forest Service for use in detection of and fighting of forest fires. The payload will be significantly simpler than that for military application and the technology of employing unattended ground sensors for monitoring the forest conditions will prove useful.","A012-1096","A01-104","01.2",

A new tomographic reconstruction algorithm Tomographic Reconstruction of Active Imaging Ladar Signals (TRAILS) is proposed for ground based laser radar imaging of unmanned-aerial vehicles (UAVs). TRAILS iteratively corrects for inaccurate UAV motion estimates and unavoidable limited-angle distortion. Limited-angle distortion is expected due to the short sweep angle over which the target motion is determined. The degree of limited-angle distortion is characterized for a UAV including determination of observable features and specification of target trajectories for which the reconstruction is optimum. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked for real-time parallel implementation using a Beowulf cluster. The radar signal is simulated using a facet-based UAV QUick Image Display (QUID) model that includes the effects of oblique angle scattering and shadowing. Iterative reconstruction is applied to these higher order models to determine limited-angle distortion motion solutions and algorithm run times.

Acoustic or screech liners have historically been designed to affect modes whose frequencies are greater than 1 kHz. Liners have proven to be a cost effective and lightweight way to control screech modes above 1 kHz but they are impractical for lower frequencies. The proposed screech suppressing liner concept absorbs screech modes below 1 kHz using a mechanical spring-mass-damper system integrated within the liner design. This is provided through use of floating liner panels installed in the augmentor using spring retainers in a manner that allows them to resonate at the desired frequency. Damping provided through use of metal foam in a constrained layer viscoelastic damper absorbs the acoustic energy thereby attenuating the pressure oscillations that lead to screech. This Phase I program will evaluate the proposed concept develop a conceptual configuration compare it to several other potential integration approaches and verify feasibility of the concept through cold flow tests that utilize existing SPIRITECH hardware to save costs. The Phase II program will further develop the concept through a detail design and hot flow testing.  BENEFIT:  This SBIR effort (Phases I and II) will result in the development and demonstration of a new acoustic damping approach that will work in concert with current acoustic liners to address lower frequency screech phenomena.  This is needed due to the potential for significant structural damage and/or performance degradation in future advanced afterburner designs where non-axisymmetric exhaust ducts may be required.  Specifically the earliest immediate application is for the 6th generation fighter engine where a radical redesign of historical afterburner architectures may be required to address low observables challenges.  Several additional government programs could benefit from this technology including RATTLRS Supersonic Cruise Missiles UAV/UCAV Aircraft and Hypersonic Aircraft with TBCC propulsion. These near-term applications suggest the need for immediate government funding to transition results of Phase II to a product with specific application to the 6th generation engine for use in a future multi-role fighter.  Beyond these needs there is also potential for application to future commercial space transportation vehicles.","F103-197-0061","AF103-197","10.3",

The objectives of this effort are to design and develop a software packagte that demonstrates significant effectiveness and utility. The Phase I software will include: an engine cycle component drag and drop interface scaling and display of analysis results using integrated graphing package. A final report will also be delivered detailing the Phase I approach software architecture object-oriented design and results. This innovation will likewise reduce engine development times and associated costs to the Air Force and DoD for manned and unmanned air vehicles (UAV) applications.  ","","AF99-205","99.1",

During Phase 1 SSG has  developed an advanced EO sensor concept combining two innovative sub-system technologies: (1)  a wide FOR ultraprecise very agile pointing/stabilization mirror assembly; and (2) an ultra- lightweight thermally stable low-cost snap-together silicon carbide (SiC) optical system.  Key  system benefits include: (1) simultaneous multispectral measurements (visible to IR); (2)  independent active/passive operation; (3) significantly improved pointing resolution with combined  scanning platform stabilization and 3D microscan; (4) significantly reduced size weight power and  cost; and (5) insensitivity to uncontrolled platform vibrations and thermal conditions.  In the Phase 2  effort proposed here a prototype of the advanced PSMA will be demonstrated.  The PSMA provides  pointing coverage over _30 deg. in 2 axes with absolute pointing accuracy of <1's urad and a scan  reversal time of <3 msec.  A revolutionary optical fringe counting encoder is used to provide mirror  position sensing; an innovative spherical Lorentz force actuator is used to drive the pointing  system; and a low-cost castable form of SiC is used as an ultra- lightweight low-cost mirror  substrate material.  The optical fringe counting encoder has demonstrated 0.05 urad LSB resolution  with >27 bits of dynamic range.  It is packaged in a 2" diam. disk weighing <0.25 lbs. and inherently  insensitive to stressing thermal and vibrational environments.  The combination of these innovative  sub-systems is truly revolutionary since there is currently no solution for a low-cost compact wide  FOV PSMA as required.  The basic Phase 2 SBIR effort proposed will be supported by a number of  government and commercial partners.  The total non-SBIR supporting tasks represent >$750K of  funding which will directly benefit the advanced EO system proposed here.  The basic SBIR effort  will fund the fabrication and testing of the prototype PSMA; the Phase 2 option will allow SSG to  integrate the PSMA prototype with navigational quality inertial reference units (fiber optic gyros) and  demonstrate active stabilization control and base ","","N96-046","96.1",

As demonstrated by our Phase I results direction of arrival estimation and point-source interference rejection using compact conformal arrays requires the integration of electromagnetic analysis and adaptive processing (super-resolution spatial adaptivity).

Adequacy of the exisitng space-time adaptive processing (STAP) algorithms in such settings is of great concern.  The proposed effort considers the effects of the bistatic geometry on space=time adaptive processing.  The goal is both to characterize a parametric model for the received bistatic waveform and to develop a MATLAB based signal processing/evaluation tool.  The result is a means to describe and assess how the characteristics of the received signal depend on platform motion beam profile internal clutter motion and the three-dimensional bistatic geometry.  This work will be necessary when evaluating a large inventory of STAP algortihms specific for bistatic space-based radars.  There are four tasks to be accomplished.  First we will implement formulas for the bistatic geometry relationships (these are described in detail in section d).  Second a bistatic equivalent of the constant Gamma model for out-of-plane scattering.  Those results are then combined to produce a MATLAB based for the purpose of generating simulated bistatic received waveforms.  This data generation capability provides an input process for the parametric evaluation of the STAP algorithms.

This is due in part to its potential in an airborne configuration where for example an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is to be used as a receiver platform. Another reason is the fact that the receiver is silent thus reducing the probability of interception directional jamming and anti-radiation missile attack. As a consequence clutter and jamming suppression is very critical . Several studies have involved performance evaluations using monostatic interference suppression techniques in a bistatic system. This effort will assess he wisdom of this approach  note however that the clutter observed in bistatic systems has characteristics more complex than in monostatic system thus complicating the clutter rejection problem. In Phase I of this effort Stiefvater Consultants inc. have successfully developed a full mathematical description of an airborne bistatic system. A very sophisticated signal model suitable for the airborne bistatic geometry was developed. This signal model will now be incorporated into a more general simulation tool. This tool will be based on the actual Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) Multi-Channel Signal Processing System (MCSPS). This capability is essential for evaluation various exisiting interference suppression algorithms as applied to airborne bistatic radars.

However using UAVs for this task is highly challenging because of difficulties in optimally retargeting the UAVs while taking into consideration multiple variables such as time to target remaining fuel uncertainties in the location and type of the TSTs avoidance of threat areas etc.  Systems for UAV control that can learn to engage TSTs with knowledge-based reasoning akin to human judgment and expeience would be highly valuable for decreasing the cognitive load on the human operator decreasing the time for decision making for  increasing the reliability and robustness of the decision making process. We propose such a system called UAV-Guide that observes and learns from the actions an expert human operator takes while  targeting and engaging TSTs. UAV-Guide combines the technologies of knowledge representation learning and human factors to address the problems of representing and reasoning with uncertain knowledge learning from observations and reducing cognitive overload.  Careful consideration has been given in UAV-Guide to issues critical to user adoption such as providing facilities for the user to direct the learning process and to override what is automatically learned when necessary.  Phase I prototype development will provide a solid foundation for complete implementation in Phase II.","N074-031-0186","N07-T031","07  ",

This ability can only be realized with an automatic capability for recognizing the intent of the pilots of these other aircraft in the complex and dynamic terminal area.  The Phase I prototype absolutely proved the feasibility of using procedure and dialog graphs fractional dialog grammars and Behavior Transition Networks for ground trajectory prediction by actually implementing them in software and demonstrating them with actual air traffic control transcripts and simulated sensor data.    The next logical step as addressed by this proposal is to develop the full-scale Intelligent Pilot Intent Analysis System (IPIAS) to support autonomous UAV ground operations and integrate it to the degree possible with the appropriate UAV systems currently being developed.  The Phase II IPIAS will analyze text recognized from actual airport ATC-Pilot communications and simulated sensor data to predict routes on the ground for aircraft on the ground taking off and landing.  We will coordinate with sibling contractors and the selected prime through early and frequent contact to ensure full understanding of the evolving requirements constraints opportunities and integration issues.     BENEFIT:  The direct target for this effort is UASs operating in the terminal area of operations (TAO).  The primary commercialization plan for IPIAS relative to this domain will be to demonstrate a significant potential for automatic intelligent pilot intent recognition thus improving safety related to UASs in the TAO with reduced manning in Phase II.  This will allow us to acquire Phase III funding to transition IPIAS to operational use.  The realization of this capability will create a demand for similar systems for other agencies (i.e. the Army Navy and Marines) since they all have UASs.  Additionally the Department of Homeland Security and the Drug Enforcement Agency have the similar problem of a growing number of UASs and the desire to operate them in the TAO.","F2-6255","AF103-007","10.3",

An integral body conforming grid generator    In Phase I viscous flow through a shrouded-fan in non-axial flight conditions  but with fixed shroud orientation will be computed as proof-of-concept of an   efficient design tool. In Phase II continuous rotation of the shroud about its  own axis such as in conversion modes from hover to forward flight will be   undertaken.

BENEFITS: The initial customer base we will approach for the new concepts would be next generation unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and prime contractors for both commercial and military aircraft applications.  The market need in these areas is very high in that the cost of UAVs is beyond the disposable range and survivability requirements are becoming realized.  In addition there are major aircraft acquisition programs within DoD that have identified fire as a very high concern yet suppression has not yet been defined. This technology has promise for expansion within the military ground vehicle and ship markets as the next logical level of progression.  It is evident that there is a firm market need in both these areas based on our experience supporting the Army and Marines in development and test of ground vehicles as well as our previous Naval ship SBIRs supporting the development of next generation fire modeling and structural failure methods. Commercial applications are nearly endless such as the automotive industry (e.g. under the hood for engine fires) restaurants and kitchens (e.g. exhaust hoods) and even at home application near water heaters and furnaces.  Because of the design simplicity systems such as this could be technician level or even user installable retrofit kits that could be purchased at automotive or appliance stores for example.   ","F083-250-1812","AF083-250","08.3",

Obstacles are detected in the infrared band and linear features are analyzed by innovative cellular automata based algorithms. Processed images are presented to the aircrew on their display as color enhanced features along with wide field of view visible images (situational awareness) for pilot evaluation and evasive action as appropriate.  The core objectives of the current effort are to further the algorithm development and to build a "test bed" system.  Several techniques have been identified to improve the algorithm performance and portability to a real time environment. The test bed system will be used to further the understanding of the radiometrics of the mission environment and explore the limits of system performance.  This knowledge will allow for a more detailed understanding of the probability of detection and probability of false alarm for the system.  Designs for the pointing and stabilization systems will be completed and proto-types built and integrated into the system.  In order to transition this technology to the user community as quickly as possible substantial effort will be applied to understanding the needs and capabilities of the user community.  BENEFITS: Military aircraft routinely fly below 1000 ft. in support of their missions.  These aircraft include fixed and rotary wing and may be manned or unmanned.  Flying at these low altitudes presents a safety hazard to the aircrew and aircraft due to the occurrences of obstacles within the aircraft's flight path.  The pilot must rely on eyesight and in some cases infrared sensors to see obstacles.  This can make it very difficult or even impossible to react in sufficient time to avoid collisions.  This problem is exacerbated at night and/or in bad weather. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have the same problem whether operating autonomously or under control of a ground operator. The UAV ground operator is even less likely to detect obstacles such as utility lines as the displays used to control the UAV have less resolution than the eyes of the aircrew.  Numerous catastrophic accidents have occurred in which aircraft collided with undetected obstacles.  Accidents of this type continue to be a problem for low flying military and commercial aircraft. Under some conditions of sun angle material reflectance etc. obstacles such as utility lines are essentially invisible even to the alerted aircrew that is focused on the outside scene.  A system that can identify these obstacles would significantly enhance the flight safety of the pilot crew and ground personnel.","","N99-052","99.1",

S. Air Force has identified a need to develop innovative technologies which will enable overall miniaturization of micro air weapons (MAW) to allow such weapons to be sufficiently compact to accommodate diverse deployment scenarios.  Miniaturization of the weapon airframe necessarily requires that airframe components be miniaturized to provide adequate volume for mission payloads.  In particular the Air Force has earmarked flight control actuation devices as critical components requiring miniaturization.  The conventional approach for control surface actuation in small air vehicles has been the use of analog or digital servos mounted in the airframe fuselage.  Control rods connect the servo horns to the air vehicles control surfaces to provide deflection forces in response to autopilot commands.  Servos work effectively. However they do occupy critical volume within the fuselage and can significantly contribute to air vehicle weight.  If servos can be replaced with miniature-actuation devices within the fuselage or more attractively replaced with miniature actuators that can be embedded directly onto the control surface both increased payload volume and reduced weight can be realized.  Accordingly the focus of this research is to identify and assess the applicability of innovative actuation technologies that afford MAW payload and weight benefits yet still provide effective control surface deflection forces to reliably maneuver the air vehicle.  Specifically the research will address three alternative technologies.  In each case the force and bandwidth provided by an actuator representing each of these technologies shall be experimentally evaluated and quantified.  BENEFIT: Several technological benefits will be derived from the successful completion of this Phase I research.   Miniaturizing airframe size will be a paramount requirement due to the inevitable emergence of swarming MAVs for ISR missions or multiple MAWs for strike applications.  To that end exploiting technologies that afford embedding actuators directly onto the control surface or wing represents a key development milestone.  By thoroughly evaluating three diverse technologies the results of this Phase I program shall indentify the most viable embedded-actuator technology for near-term implementation on both military and commerical UAV platforms.","F083-097-0545","AF083-097","08.3",

S. Air Force has identified a need to develop innovative concepts for gathering timely and accurate bomb damage assessment (BDA) information.   This information is used by mission planners to quantify the success of an airborne attack determine the extent of any collateral damage and ultimately provide information as to whether additional attacks are necessary.   One particularly attractive BDA concept involves the use of low-value assets such as micro air vehicles (MAVs) to gather BDA information and transmit this information to applicable ground or airborne platforms.  The sensor-equipped MAV would be attached to an air-launched munition and deployed at a pre-determined point along the munition's descent trajectory.  Following deployment the air vehicle would achieve stable flight and proceed to the target area to record the impact event and gather post-impact BDA imagery.  The MAV would continue to loiter in the target area and transmit real-time imagery until its on-board power source was exhausted.  The focus of this research is to develop implementable hardware and software solutions that enable the use of low-cost expendable MAVs for BDA missions.  Specifically the research will address: (1) the design fabrication and packaging of the munition-deployed MAV (2) the stability and autonomous guidance and navigation capability of the air vehicle and (3) the collection and transmission of real-time video imagery from the MAV's on-board sensor. Camera-equipped MAVs have great potential for surveillance and monitoring tasks in areas either too remote or too dangerous to send human scouts.  Opera-tional MAVs will enable a number of important missions including chemical/radiation spill monitoring forest-fire reconnaissance visual monitoring of volcanic activity surveys of natural disaster areas and even inexpensive traffic and accident monitoring.  Additional on-board sensors can further augment MAV mission profiles to include for example airborne chemical analysis.   As other examples of MAV benefits consider  the following scenarios.  The forestry service is interested in tracking wildlife migration patterns within its park; a hiker is lost in the wilderness; people are trapped in trees or on rooftops during flooding following a major hurricane.  In each instance small UAVs or MAVs capable of self-stabilized flight could be deployed to actively search and track motion and/or targets of interest on the ground.","F021-1911","AF02-141","02.1",

The total LADAR package is 3.5 inches diameter by 8 inches long with power under 100 watts dominated by laser pump power.  LADAR image processing will be handled by HyperX matrix processor a fabric of 100 processors on a chip clock by clock reconfigurable having power per flop 1/10 competitive units.  The LADAR will be capable of classifying guiding the round to the target and discrimination of targets.  Last pixel processing allows locating targets under heavy foliage and camouflage nets.  BENEFIT:  The use of an imaging LADAR for guided smart munitions allows good weather performance excellent discrimination and tracking accuracy and the ability to defeat objects hidden under heavy foliage or camouflage nets.

However GPS is susceptible to jamming and therefore new approaches are needed that can provide the same level of navigation accuracy while operating in a GPS-denied environment.  Under this effort we will develop a sensor fusion system based on a Bayesian framework that combines the measurements from a set of complementary sensors such as a star tracker a magnetometer a horizon sensor and signals of opportunity to aid in navigation.  We will develop efficient inferencing techniques that enable us to combine the measurements within the stringent time constraints of high speed munitions.  We will perform trade studies to understand the relative impacts of each of the sensor types and perform sensitivity studies to determine sensor performance specifications required to achieve GPS-level performance.  We will compare these specifications to existing hardware and perform an analysis of the size weight and power requirements.  This will drive the Phase 2 analysis of specific weapon systems.  BENEFIT:  The resulting system will enable GPS-level navigation accuracy in GPS-denied environments.  This has applicability not only to munitions but also to UAVs and manned systems.  It also has commercial potential for supersonic transport and space applications.","F121-091-1992","AF121-091","12.1",

During the Phase I effort the effectiveness of the  automatic guidance and securing systems will be analyzed and demonstrated.  Handling and transportation of the aircraft will also be possible without disengaging the securing mechanism.  Furthermore the proposed system will overcome a major deficiency in current systems by requiring the aircraft to be outfitted with only a securing pin in place of 200 lb grappling hook.  Use of a single attachment point will allow for the aircraft to be easily rotated into the wind during takeoffs.  Furthermore the handling system will have a limited logistical burden and can be integrated with little to no modification of the existing ship structure. The proposed system will provide benefits for all shipboard helicopter flight operations.  This low-cost simplistic recovery securing and handling system will benefit both military and commercial helicopter operators.

The first employs a recently published technique Focused Dynamic Programming [1] which offers the benefits of both the LAO* algorithm [2] (LAO* subsumes Dijkstra's algorithm) and the Prioritized Sweeping algorithm [3]. Focused Dynamic Programming uses heuristics to limit the number of states examined during the value iteration so that the value updates are used most effectively.  The second algorithm formulates the path optimization as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem. This approach is particularly convenient because (i) it allows a wide range of operationally relevant elements to be accounted for in the optimization and (ii) the formulated problem can be immediately solved by existing commercial or non-commercial optimization software. Both of the proposed algorithms appear well-suited to account for multi-objective cost functions and incorporate constraints driven by platform dynamics and rules of engagement. Additionally the algorithms have been selected because of their potential to produce solutions for rapidly changing battlespace conditions.

It is composed of three parts:  a noise reduction filter a speech recognizer and a data link interface.  The noise reduction filter processes the audio signal from the ATC controller reduces background noise and enhances the speech clarity.  This clean audio is fed into a speech recognizer system that parses the spoken phrase into its component parts and determines if the utterance is a valid command phrase.  This will be accomplished using an adapted commercial HMM-based speech recognition engine a custom ATC grammar and context-based information from the current situation.  Appropriate safeguards will ensure the command is valid and appropriate before the data link interface will be engaged to create and send the appropriate data link message.  Cues and feedback will be given to the controller to show proper operation of the speech recognition system and to relay designated data link messages received from aircraft. AUSPICE crosses disciplines to provide a seamless and effective voice-to-data conversion system for air traffic control.  BENEFITS: The primary means for ATC controllers to communicate with aircraft is by verbal radio transmissions.  However the current evolution of technology is bringing about more and more aircraft communication by data link messages.  While this is true for both manned and unmanned aircraft the dichotomy between verbal and data link commands becomes especially acute for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).  As UAVs become increasingly autonomous they will no longer require the constant control of a dedicated pilot/operator.  Without such a pilot/operator to hear and respond to verbal ATC commands the UAV will need some other means to communicate with ATC.  This is where the importance of an ATC voice-to-data link conversion system becomes apparent.  Such a system would allow the seamless integration of advanced data link messaging systems into the current voice-based ATC system.  To the ATC controller it may even become transparent whether the aircraft under control is manned or unmanned--they will both respond to verbal commands even if the UAV is actually receiving a data link message instead of the verbal command.  Enabling the seamless integration of voice and data link messages will foster the development of more advanced data link communications and expand the viability of UAVs for a wide range of applications.","N061-012-0108","N06-012","06.1",

Flying insects provide excellent models from which guidance navigation and moving target detection/tracking principles can be derived and applied for military usage.  Many animals have visual sensing and processing that operate under very weak ambient illumination. Nocturnal hawkmoths are capable of precise visually guided hovering and rapid flight under starlight conditions.  Strategies for developing bio-vision for military use under low light conditions include temporal and spatial integration. The motion detectors of nocturnal species employ radically different temporal filters than diurnal insects and elementary motion detection (EMD) involves nonlinear processing therefore neural integration along with nonlinear EMD operations may yield a more nearly optimal approach to motion processing under low light levels.  In Phase I the academic partner will study and model motion processing in nocturnal hawkmoths and the commercial partner will develop an approach to implement this enabling technology in analog VLSI and (optionally) plan its integration with other key technologies (e.g. tunable MEMS etalons) into a multi-spectral sensor system.

A single-chip multispectral FPA is desired so that a pilot may electrically switch between the available bands enhancing target discovery while maintaining original sight and orientation information.  It is also desired that the FPA be lightweight so that the camera can be integrated with pilot’s visor system.  Unfortunately existing technologies (ex. silicon FPA intensifier tubes thermal imagers and InGaAs photodiodes) either have limited spectral response or lack spectral selectivity (thus require filters).  Furthermore the traditional bolometer trade space precludes the development of uncooled high speed and low noise bolometer devices at room temperature.    Tanner Research is proposing to leverage recent developments in nanophotonics to circumvent the traditional spectral limitations and bolometer trade spaces.  We propose the use of our demonstrated nanobolometer concept and further develop it into a low noise high-speed multispectral uncooled silicon-based FPA imager in Phase II.  In Phase I we will provide proof of concept demonstrations in single devices that demonstrate the scalability of our technology across multiple detection bands.

If similar performance could be realized in autonomous flying vehicles and weapons it would greatly enhance their effectiveness by enabling near-ground flight in urban forest and indoor/in-cave environments. We have investigated the integration of biomimetic visual motion detection and flight control for collision avoidance in Phase I. Visual processing is based on adaptive motion detection as observed in flies. Adaptation has the effect of reducing detector dependence on non-motion-related parameters of visual stimuli improving estimates of optic flow. The control theory is based on a model for wide-field neurons (tangential cells) that spatially integrate local optic flow estimates. The outputs of these integrators are applied as feedback signals for direct control of vehicle dynamics. When combined these algorithms provide a reflexive or inner control loop for avoiding collisions and centering in clutter. In Phase II we propose to develop a demonstration of the combined algorithms in autonomous vehicles develop an implementation suitable for use in a small UAV integrate the lower-level reflexive guidance with higher- or mission-level control and establish a road map for integration into an operational micro-UAV in Phase III.","F2-3628","AF06-149","06.1",

In Phase I we showed that the Wave Process can better detect low contrast targets when augmented with Sampled-Time Elementary Motion Detection for isolated noise removal a positive-feedback gain feature that boosts the target signal and a shape-finding function for pulling very dim targets out of the noise.

A large sideways momentum drag component is characteristic of any ducted fan vehicle flying in gusts and methods are sought to for better control when subjected to large unsteady forces.  Techsburg by teaming with AVID Honeywell Labs and MLB proposes an aggressive analytical and experimental work plan to take advantage of current methodologies and testing resources developed as part of large VTOL UAV program. The proposed work plan focuses on selection and aerodynamic modeling of a candidate VTOL UAV control systems. The most promising of these ideas will then be wind tunnel tested by integrating the new control system with an existing VTOL UAV wind tunnel model. These results can then be used as input into an existing control system modeling framework that can be used to predict the vehicle's dynamic response to turbulence. In addition to an improved flight control system insights into establishing disturbance rejection criteria for VTOL UAVs will be gained and can be used for future vehicle development efforts. As the military becomes increasingly engaged in unconventional battlefield scenarios the need for enhanced situational awareness will be filled by small UAVs capable of hovering flight. The control system development proposed here will be licensed or otherwise used as part of a VTOL UAV program with the goal of providing the military with a very stable yet maneuverable aerial sensor platform. If this is achieved many vehicle units will be bought by the military and other law enforcement groups. The commercial potential for UAVs in general has been demonstrated by the interest generated recently by the Predator and Global Hawk UAVs operating in the Afgan theatre.

Although beneficial in many ways a major operational problem of ducted fan vehicles is disturbance rejection when flying in turbulent or gusty winds. Transverse momentum drag and maintaining vehicle trim over a large speed range present significant problems for the vehicle control system. Phase I testing of various new and innovative auxiliary control effectors for ducted-fan vehicles has been encouraging. Wind tunnel tests using a powered ducted-fan VTOL UAV model have demonstrated that these auxiliary control devices can change the pitching moment characteristics of the vehicle and were particularly effective in the presence of a longitudinal crosswind or gust.      In collaboration with Honeywell and AVID LLC a Phase II work plan combining experiments and modeling of the vehicle and control systems has been developed. The objective goal of the project is to demonstrate an improved control system during flight test on a technically mature ducted-fan VTOL UAV. An optional plan is presented to demonstrate improved control in a wind tunnel environment. Either test plan will demonstrate a vehicle and control system with improved maneuverability and handling qualities in gusts. Research to improving the control system design will lead to VTOL UAVs with improved handling and more mission capability. Some future mission scenarios such as the "perch and stare" mission rely heavily on maneuverability to land with precision. Urban missions are another area where the vehicles need to fly precisely in an enhanced turbulence environment. It is safe to say that improved control systems are one of the technology areas in the critical path for successful development and adoption of these vehicles for military and commercial use.    The commercial potential for UAVs in general has been demonstrated by the interest generated recently by the Predator and Global Hawk UAVs operating in the Afgan theatre. If these aircraft can be made reliable easily controlled and inexpensive other civilian markets will open up. These potential customers include local police and fire departments urban news centers aerial inspection and surveying services and real estate firms.","A2-1074","A02-079","02.2",

Consequently it is a challenge to reliably detect and track ground moving targets in an endo-clutter environment with weak signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio conditions.  To meet these challenges TSC employs a mix of innovative techniques and processing including CFAR processing video differencing M of N detection and feature discrimination.  The TSC approach consists of a single aperture simultaneous observations of the target as the target moves through a series of short CPI images.  This approach offers several advantages.  The single aperture technique reduces antenna hardware complexity and requires no additional radar channel hardware so it should have minimal impact on existing hardware cost and time to implement and field.  The GMTI mode operates simultaneously with SAR and has minimal impact on SAR concept of operations and SAR coverage rates.

For example both monopulse and space-time adaptive processing (STAP) have traditionally been based on monolithic planar arrays rather than on the conformal arrays of Sensor Craft or the sparse volume arrays formed by a cluster of microsatellites or small UAVs.  Additionally existing techniques have failed to exploit the interaction of the target with its electromagnetic environment by incorporating auxiliary sources of knowledge such as DTED and LU/LC.  Terrain exploitation Prony's method of array processing and stereoscopic radar processing are three new and innovative concepts that overcome many of the limitations of more traditional overland height-finding methods.  These techniques were shown to be feasible during the Phase I effort.  To facilitate the transition of these techniques into operational and future air surveillance systems the Phase II effort will demonstrate and minimize the sensitivity of the three height-finding techniques to real-world effects including errors in the environmental knowledge that is being exploited.  The final sensitivities will be used to prepare hardware and software specifications for the algorithms.  Specific air surveillance systems with which the techniques are compatible will be identified.  The techniques will be optimized for these systems and performance will be validated by processing sets of high fidelity synthetic data which will be used in lieu of recorded radar data.","F2-1120","AF02-219","02.1",

The ultimate objective of this program is to adapt the AR Microstructure (ARMs) technology and fabrication processes for use with the innovative sensor designs offered by the Image Sensor Division of Teledyne Imaging Sensors (TIS) a major commercial supplier of state-of-the-art detector products.  In a directly related MDA sponsored Phase II Enhancement program ARMs technology has been successfully integrated and tested with functional sensors produced by BAE Systems a second major supplier of infrared imaging detectors. To ensure the supply of high functioning infrared sensors and to promote innovation multiple detector manufacturers with varying device designs have been supported by the military and have supplied fully qualified detectors.  A Phase II project is needed to demonstrate the integration of ARMs technology with TIS microlens-based sensor arrays.  It is expected that up to two functional sensor arrays fabricated with the new ARMs treatment will be delivered to the Air Force for further testing.  BENEFIT:  ARMs technology offers the potential for higher performance detector arrays combined with increased environmental survivability and reduced costs associated with improved fabrication yields.  It is anticipated that the increased sensor quantum efficiency over a wider infrared bandwidth afforded by the ARMs treatment will allow for longer range detection of missile threats – allowing the warfighter more time to evade.

For maximum effectiveness laser systems under development for the CIRCM ABL and next generation UAV programs require increased power and broad wavelength agility.  Promising tunable mid-IR solid state laser sources depend on conventional thin-film coating technology to achieve critical optical functions such as anti-reflection (AR) high reflection (HR) and spectral or polarization filtering.  Thin-film coatings are easily damaged within high power laser systems and the threshold for coating damage decreases as the demand for higher performance or wider bandwidth increases.  As a primary example of this performance/reliability tradeoff developers scaling the power output and tuning range of metal-ion doped semiconductor lasers opt for more complex less stable laser cavity configurations with reduced efficiency in order to avoid the use of thin-film AR and HR coatings directly on the laser gain material facets.  Dramatic increases in the power output and tuning range of these laser sources could be attained by development of a more robust AR treatment applied to the gain material facets alone.  An innovative AR treatment based on surface relief microstructures has been shown to have great potential for increasing the reliability and power handling capacity of optical components.  AR microstructures (ARMs) etched directly in the surface of relevant IR transmitting materials have consistently exhibited damage thresholds 2 times higher than untreated surfaces a value that equates to a 4-5 time increase over any equivalent performance broad-band thin-film AR coated surface.  This Phase I project proposes to demonstrate robust wide bandwidth high performance ARMs textures built in the end facets of chromium ion (Cr2+) doped zinc selenide (ZnSe) and zinc sulfide (ZnS) laser gain material.  Multiple ARMs design variants will be fabricated in ZnSe ZnS and Cr2+:ZnSe coupons and subjected to standardized pulsed and continuous wave laser damage testing.  Additional ARMs treated coupons of the most promising designs will be delivered to the Government for further damage testing.  In collaboration with IR laser manufacturer IPG Photonics the new robust AR treatment will be integrated into critical AFRL systems during Phase II and Phase III commercialization projects.  BENEFIT:  It is anticipated that a dramatic increase in laser power handling capacity combined with enhanced operational lifetime will be achieved through the integration of anti-reflecting microstructures in solid state laser systems.  In particular the broad-band performance of ARMs will benefit tunable metal-ion doped ZnSe and ZnS lasers that find a wide range of applications throughout the mid-IR spectral region.  Air Force applications requiring more reliable higher power wavelength agile mid-IR laser sources include laser communications countermeasures target designators weapons rangefinders remote chemical sensors and infrared scene projectors. Commercial applications include environmental chemical monitoring industrial welding and cutting systems and food processing.  Significant advances in medical devices for surgery noninvasive treatments breath diagnostics and imaging await higher power laser sources as do astronomical instruments for spectroscopy planetary exploration earth and solar observations and optical telecommunications.  Although the proposed effort will immediately benefit metal ion doped ZnSe and ZnS laser materials the robust nature of ARMs can be extended to any current or emerging laser technology such as quantum cascade lasers zinc germanium phosphide lasers and semiconductor microchip lasers as well as silica and chalcogenide glass optical fiber laser delivery systems.","F103-190-1023","AF103-190","10.3",

TeraOps will design and develop a ruggedized prototype system suitable for field use.  Hardware based on the latest signal processing technology will enable the creation of an extremely compact fusion processor using less than 10 W of power. The fusion processor will be able to generate both gray-scale and false-colored images of high quality and readability by evaluating information contained in the input images at every point in space and time.  The highly optimized output image containing all salient features available from input images will be displayed using a lightweight head-mounted display unit which will also contain a compact multi-spectral sensor package. The resulting system will enable mobile personnel to efficiently operate in low-visibility environments including closed spaces and urban environments.BENEFITS: The proposed research and development effort aims to enhance current night vision capabilities through the utilization of a wider range of the imaging electromagnetic spectrum. Results from this effort would therefore directly benefit applications that include night vision as an essential component.   Military applications include low-visibility operations pilotage and driving as well as target detection identification and tracking.  Multi-spectral night vision goggles are expected to significantly improve situational awareness of personnel operating in dark environments enhance the maneuvering and landing ability and increase safety of operating aerial sea and ground vehicles under low-visibility conditions.  Significant improvements are also expected in targeting where the tasks of target detection identification and tracking which typically appear in combination would clearly benefit from the fusion of visible and infrared in formation in a single image.  These capabilities can be provided by the proposed portable system for troops while extended versions of the system based on higher-end sensors would be appropriate for vehicle-based applications.  Due to the compact lightweight and low-power characteristics of the proposed system application in UAVs and smart munitions is also possible.  Commercial applications include civilian aviation both in the form of landing instruments for commercial aircraft and as ground-based instrumentation for flight control and runway surveillance.  Applications in industrial inspection non-destructive testing and process control as well as in commercial and private asset protection surveillance search and rescue law enforcement and firefighting are also expected.

For many years the Army has pursued the development of UAVs and munitions that provide battle field assessments and strike capability to aid and identify enemy positions and assets with a means to destroy them.  Generally the ISR (Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance) missions have been supported more heavily with UAV assets like Predator (aircraft).  The predator is extremely slow compared to a missile and would require reasonably close proximity to a hot zone of interest if real-time intelligence is critical.

Cerebus a small (~100 pound) VTOL UAV based on a new platform already flying is proposed as a moving sensor that can be positioned around harbors "perching" on rooftops and hilltops with commanding views of facilities and harbors for force protection surveillance and patrols.  Inspection of small craft approaching Naval surface vessels or if equipped with magnetic anomally detectors Cerebus can support detection of tactical submairines of rogue states in the littoral where sonobouys are unreliable or ineffective.  Cerebus can also support special operations forces or  even feature offensive capabilities to support fight-through and recovery for forward deployed forces from a terrorist attack. The successful completion of the proposed effort would provide the Navy with an innovative asset that would increase forward deployed security and ability to prevent and respond effectively to terrorist activity.

It is proposed to replace the standard metal finned circulating glycol/water heat exchanger with a droplet heat exchanger developed in this program.  A circulating liquid sprayed into a ducted airstream creates a dense droplet field that directly transfers heat from the liquid to the gas and is then captured at the end of the duct by inertial separation from a sharply turning flow.  A droplet heat exchanger efficiently rejects engine heat under widely varying conditions while greatly reducing heat exchanger weight and lowering aircraft drag.  Heat transfer can be increased for high altitude flight lower weight increases altitude capability and together with decreased drag increases range.  Heat transfer and droplet collection can be maintained during speed and attitude changes and the system tolerates rain snow and dust.

UAV flight paths are periodically computed on a discretization of the search space using dynamic programming and are optimal on the grid with respect to a tradeoff between probability of acquisition and total flight time. Paths will account for terrain and potential obscuration of the targets and will each terminate in a rounded rectangle around the target(s) that respects standoff requirements. Sensor controls are dynamically selected in order to minimize the information-theoretic entropy of a tracking database. Our system will work with electro-optical sensors mounted on the routable UAVs and moving target indicator radars mounted on a fixed-orbit UAV. Cooperative sensor management can exploit the strengths of each type of sensor to provide the data necessary for a system to perform CSAT operations even in the presence of obscuration. We will modify existing open-source software to develop a video tracking module for use by the UAVs.

Agents will be expected to perform a variety of cooperative missions such as persistent intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) target search acquisition and tracking area denial and battle damage assessment under dynamically-varying bandwidth limitations intermittent communications and limited information. The key feature of the proposed cooperative control system is the use of an estimator-based distributed control (EBDC) architecture allowing each UAV to internally model and anticipate the actions of the others UAVs. Under this EBDC architecture the control system can gracefully scale from essentially centralized control (complete and perfect inter-vehicle communication) to completely distributed control (no inter-vehicle communication). The estimator-based distributed architecture models a centralized design by forcing each individual agent in the system to compute future control actions for all agents as a function of the agents' positions and the global information state (GIS). The quality and amount of communication between agents determines the accuracy of each agent's GIS estimate. Each agent's GIS estimate in turn determines the accuracy of each agent's control estimates for the other agents. In this way the EBDC algorithms transition from an essentially centralized solution to a completely decentralized solution based on the communication rate and information available to each agent within the cooperative network. The performance of the system will be guaranteed to degrade gracefully with the level of information available to each agent because the EBDC algorithms optimize the control actions based on the existing information instead of attempting to optimize the communication network to allow better throughput. In the Phase II effort Toyon and UCSB will enhance and refine the EBDC algorithms developed under Phase I. Implementation of these algorithms will continue in both MATLAB and Toyon's higher-fidelity SLAMEM(TM)  simulation tool. We will test and demonstrate their effectiveness in cooperative search and tracking scenarios under varying levels of information throughput. Bandwidth limitations time delays with uncertain intervals and network topology limitations will be incorporated into the simulation. The extent of reliable communications required to ensure robust cooperative control will be evaluated.","F2-3171","AF05-T011","05  ",

Agents will be expected to perform a variety of cooperative missions such as persistent intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) target search acquisition and tracking area denial attack and battle damage assessment under dynamically-varying bandwidth limitations intermittent communications and limited information. Two key features of the proposed cooperative control system include (1) the use of an estimator-based distributed architecture allowing each UAV to internally model the actions of the others and (2) the introduction of a communications index to scale the algorithms from centralized control to distributed control.  The estimator-based distributed architecture models a centralized design by attempting to compute the control actions for each individual agent as a function of the agents' positions and the global information state (GIS). The communication index permits our control algorithms to transition from a completely centralized solution to a decentralized one based on the information rate available to each agent within the cooperative network. The performance of the system will be guaranteed to degrade gracefully with the level of information available to each agent.  Toyon will implement the algorithms developed under this effort in its SLAMEMT simulation and will demonstrate their effectiveness under varying levels of information throughput. In Phase I Toyon will use a simple cooperative search and attack scenario to demonstrate the performance of the system in real-time. Bandwidth limitations time delays with uncertain intervals and network topology limitations will be incorporated into the simulation. The extent of reliable communications required to ensure robust cooperative control will be evaluated. In Phase II Toyon will improve the algorithms and simulation models and will demonstrate the real-time operation of the concept for an Air Force approved scenario.","F054-011-0084","AF05-T011","05  ",

We propose the multiple hypotheses tracking (MHT) algorithm for each UAV local tracker as well as the fusion node. This will provide cost effective algorithm and software development and maintenance. The local UAV tracker will process target centroid pixel locations and feature measurements extracted from its video imagery. The video processor at each UAV will perform frame registration change detection target segmentation target location measurement and target feature measurement. The pixel location measurement in the image plane is a nonlinear function of the 3D target location in the global coordinate frame. This nonlinear mapping depends on the camera location orientation focal length and intrinsic camera parameters. Thus the local UAV tracker will use a nonlinear filtering algorithm such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) or unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The UAV tracker will also process track data as feedback received from the fusion node. The fusion node will process track data received from a number of local UAV MHT trackers.

The proposed product will be compact lightweight low-power and easy to use enabling a single user with no additional or specialized training to implement; the user may don the HMD and the proposed product will automatically adjust to the user’s IPD without any user responsibility. At the heart of the proposed technical solution to the IPD measurement problem are advanced image processing algorithms capable of feature detection for pupil localization as well as high-accuracy measurement of surfaces in 3D physical coordinates based on calibrated stereo-imaging. In Phase I Toyon proposes algorithm development and implementation test and evaluation and system design and analysis to demonstrate feasibility of the technical solution to the IPD measurement problem as well as design of human factors experimentation to demonstrate solution effectiveness. In planned Phase II efforts the real-time compact lightweight HMD-mounted prototype would be built for human factors experimentation to demonstrate accuracy fitting time and user comfort.  BENEFIT:  The successful completion of this effort will result in a new capability to rapidly accurately and automatically measure IPDs for adjustment of HMD stereoscopic imagery. There is the possibility of direct transition of this technology into Air Force and other DoD HMD applications including the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) helmet and simulated flight trainers. The technology could also be transitioned into use in the larger market of civilian aircraft flight training. There are many other similar applications in vehicle simulation training to which the developed measurement device could be applied with minimal additional non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost including automotive or tank training simulators.  There are a plethora of other fields where stereoscopic helmet displays can be utilized for simulation training or augmented reality purposes such as remote or robotic surgery or UAV/UGV remote piloting.  Medical applications could also benefit from more advanced 3D surface modeling and measurement algorithms as well as the possibility of using stereoscopic displays for surgical training or utilization in remote medicine applications. Measuring IPD is a standard optometric technique for fitting glasses for those in need of corrective eyewear and this solution could potentially be transitioned into that market as a standalone device at competitive pricing.  Adaptation to some of these new applications might require considerably more development but the potential return on the investment is substantial.","F121-028-1858","AF121-028","12.1",

(1) Toyon will perform a system-level trade study of layered sensing architectures using SLAMEM® Toyons comprehensive C4ISR entity level simulation.   This will include analysis of alternatives for layered sensing architectures that accomplish situational awareness (including detection tracking location and ID of 80% of high-value targets) in a simulated battlespace-demo inspired by the Air Force USA-1a scenario.

The system will consist of a single control station and two or more remote stations that can be ground-based or UAV based. The primary focus of this effort will be to locate sources of GPS interference such as jammers. In order to achieve the highest localization accuracy possible while keeping costs low the proposed system will be a hybrid implementation of a bearings-only measurement system and a time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) system. Each remote station will synchronously sample and store the monopulse direction-finding (DF) RF information and compute a bearing measurement. These bearing measurements along with power measurements will then be transmitted to the control station and be used to determine whether or not any of the measurements are potentially from the same emitter. In addition the control station will periodically request that the remote stations transmit the stored samples which correspond to the previously submitted bearing measurements for further processing. At this point both TDOA and differential-Doppler (DD) techniques can be utilized to further improve the initial bearings-only emitter location estimates.     The loss of GPS signal lock due to intentional and unintentional interference signals is a real threat to military and civilian positioning and navigation systems which cannot always be avoided. Hence this threat location estimation and characterization network can be used to potentially find and eliminate sources of GPS jamming signals as well as for improved battlefield awareness and mission planning. In addition the threat localization concept is applicable for any commercial or military wireless system that is subjected to electromagnetic interference such as GPS aided aircraft navigation systems wireless communications wireless local-area-networks and wireless personal-area-networks such as Bluetooth. Because of the immense popularity of these systems there is a growing need and a large commercial market for systems that can locate and track unintentional emissions as well as RF jammers. The emitter localization and characterization network concept proposed by Toyon Research Corporation satisfies that need.","N012-0375","N01-120","01.2",

Following these advancements is a growing demand to provide the same WAMI capabilities for smaller UAVs by reducing the cost size weight and power (SWaP) of the currently available solutions.

Unfortunately unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) have highly constrained Size Weight and Power (SWAP) requirements and yet need access to the same sophisticated NAVWAR algorithms and hardware that protect larger air vehicles. Furthermore most military navigation systems including UAVs rely on GPS which is inherently susceptible to intentional and unintentional sources of electromagnetic interference. Electronic protection (EP) of GPS traditionally requires a large antenna array adaptive processing or Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) techniques. There is therefore a need to combine GPS EP with ES capabilities in a small form-factor while ensuring that the system is not susceptible to blue-force Electronic Attack (EA). Toyon has developed several key technologies needed for the successful fusion of these NAVWAR functions including an antenna array with STAP processing highly effective anti-spoof and multipath-mitigating processing techniques GPS angle-of-arrival measurements for precise platform attitude determination and jammer angle of arrival detection algorithms for jammer geolocation. During this effort Toyon will develop algorithms to combine these key GPS technologies and integrate them in an FPGA or ASIC utilizing less than one watt of power.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefits of this program include the development of a robust anti-jam navigation system that is efficiently integrated into a low-power integrated circuit that simultaneously provides precise direction-finding and attitude-determination capabilities and which enable the geolocation of jammers jammer-aided navigation home-on-jam and GPS spoof detection.

This module will combine an efficient modulation waveform efficient video compression target tracking and compact packaging technology in a volume of 2.5 cubic inches. The modulation waveform uses Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) which is the highest efficiency modulation standard currently available. The modution format is 802.16e mobile WiMAX which is designed for high multipath rejections under mobile operating conditions. The proposed video compression uses IEEE H.264 which is the highest performance video compression currently available. The transceiver interface will also be coupled with Toyon''s GeoTrack system for target recognition and tracking. This provides the highest possible data compression in cases where the most crucial data are target locations. Toyon has demonstrated experience with the compact packaging technology needed to implement this transceiver. The design uses a single integrated integrated circuit for WiMAX baseband processing video compression and target tracking in order to minimize transceiver volume.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefit of this program is a compact lightweight transceiver enabling high bandwidth communications including compressed video for a variety of platforms including UAVs.","F093-213-0902","AF093-213","09.3",

MAVs and small unmanned aerial vehicles place severe size weight and power constraints on avionics and sensor payloads. Although current systems have collocated navigation guidance and control electronics they are not fully integrated for optimal navigation and control. Toyon proposes to develop a Software-Defined Navigation(TM) (SDN(TM)) system with Integrated Guidance and Control (IGC) specifically for small platforms. The integrated design will eliminate redundancy while improving robustness and performance. The plug-and-play SDN/IGC system will accept inputs from a variety of sensors including gyros accelerometers magnetometers and several novel sensors currently under development at Toyon. These include a very small GPS-based attitude sensor an ultrasonic ranging device and an optical-flow sensor with reduced computational requirements. The system will provide robust guidance and control under disturbances such as wind gusts while enhancing the operational envelope under GPS-denied or jammed conditions. While ambitious the proposed SDN/IGC system is realizable and will significantly improve the performance of small autonomous platforms. Toyon will design the system during Phase I and build test and demonstrate a prototype during the Phase II effort.","F071-259-0842","AF071-259","07.1",

Toyon Research Corporation proposes to solve this problem by using our proprietary EM/Power toolkit to design an antenna with a reception pattern shaped to mitigate interference. Our methodology will allow us to build an anti-RFI antenna that is robust inexpensive and a drop-in replacement for existing GPS antennas. An antenna designed to mitigate RFI would allow for more sensors and transmitters to be placed on a single airborne test platform. The existing data links would be able to operate at higher power levels and hence higher data rates if receivers on the platform were less sensitive to RFI. This type of antenna would also be applicable for use on UAVs as well as commercial aviation.","F021-2376","AF02-303","02.1",

In order to expand the IFSAR   utility to UAVs in today's military a number of hurdles must be   overcome.  First a low-power and compact prototype must be   provided due to the limited payload and power resources on a   UAV.   Next a low-cost and pseudo real-time design is highly   demanded in military UAV operations because they can be   continuously integrated and upgraded with the advent of new   development.

Trident   proposes to continue development of the IFSAR prototype by   investigating all implementation aspects augmenting and   improving existing techniques and manipulation capabilities and   integrating COTS components.  Phase II will include seven major   task areas which collectively represent an aggressive success-  oriented approach culminating in the production of a functional   prototype suitable for evaluation and testing in simulated and   real-world environments.  In addition the development process   will ensure the existence of migration paths for Phase III   applications of the resulting technology.

RF power levels required for these high frequency high data rate link budgets have not been effectively satisfied by the use of solid state amplifiers. The Traveling Wave Tube (TWT) due to its simultaneous frequency-bandwidth-power characteristics has been the answer to many military and commercial data link requirements.   As military and commercial data links become more sophisticated complex modulations (such as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation QAM and others) are desired for a variety of reasons. The amplification of these modulated signals demands that the amplifier be operated in a highly linear fashion in order to preserve phase and amplitude content without distortion an increase in Bit Error Rate (BER) and/or adjacent channel interference. A Typical TWT has 6 dB gain compression and about 40 degrees of phase change at saturated power out. Thus in order to operate in a fully linear fashion a TWT would have to be operated at or near the small signal region. An output power back off (OPBO) from saturation of 6 dB would not be uncommon.  This is a huge disadvantage in term of device efficiency and link power.   The most recent answer to this dilemma has been to create linearized TWT Amplifiers (TWTAs). Linearization can be accomplished by several methods both internal and external to the TWT. Triton’s preferred method is to utilize a pre-distortion linearizer as a pre-amplifier to the TWT. The linearizer is constructed with gain and phase distortion complementary to the distortion of the TWT. The combined performance effectively increases the linear operating range of the amplifier. One successful Ku Band amplifier was able to increase the linear operating range to within 2 dB of saturation a 2½ times increase in usable (linear) power. Distortion levels of AM/PM &#8804; 2º/dB and AM/AM &#8804;1.2 dB/dB were obtained at 70 watts of output power and below.  Up until now there have been few if any highly linear amplifiers in the range of 43.5 to 45.5 GHz and at this medium power level. The three major thrusts of this proposal are directed at answering that need.  • The development of a basic TWT-type vacuum device which is capable of producing 50 watts at 43.5 to 45.5 GHz. • A method to overcome the inevitable linearity deficits of the TWT. • A Power Supply and associated support elements required to create a workable ultra-linear TWTA. Triton Services Inc. has had over 40 years of experience in manufacturing TWTs TWTAs MPMs and other related sub-systems. Based on our many decades of experience and previous millimeter-wave developments we propose to create an ultra-linear EHF TWTA combining a pre-distortion linearizer a specially designed TWT using advanced fabrication techniques and a custom power conditioner which feeds the active components. During the Phase I we will design and demonstrate the design elements necessary to produce the ultra-linear EHF TWTA.  Preliminary calculations based on TWT theory and various design codes will be employed to determine optimum design parameters for the EHF TWT. Several possible mechanical configurations and thermal attachments for the TWT RF circuit will be evaluated for manufacturability cost effectiveness and ability to remove heat from the beam interaction region.  The linearizer requirements will be developed working in concert with our long-time business partner Linearizer Technology Inc. (LTI).  LTI has been the premier supplier of advanced linearizers to Triton and the entire TWT and Satcom communities. Recent advances in the state of the art at LTI have resulted in several linearizers in Q Band including the 43.5 to 45.5 GHz segment. Phase I will define a working linearizer specification based on the modeled complex gain parameters of the EHF TWT. Initial costs for the linearizer would also be obtained. Based on the operating voltages and currents predicted for the EHF TWT and the linearizer a new Power Conditioner specification will be developed. This specification will be reviewed with our various power supply vendors; 5-Star Associates Brandt Electronics or DB Control for feasibility and cost.  While the exact final TWT operating voltages may change as the design progresses this will most likely represent only minor impact to the overall power conditioner.  Cost and technical content of the power conditioner should be quite similar to a final design . In Phase II we will develop and manufacture a fully functioning ultra-linear EHF TWTA prototype. Based on the EHF TWT design work and construction technique investigations necessary high-precision tooling will be designed and procured. The circuit assembly method and precise alignment fixturing will be developed and verified.  Several TWT iterations are expected. Using test data from a successful EHF TWT specifications for the power conditioner and linearizer will be finalized and initial units procured. The assembled components will then be optimized and tested to characterize and verify linear performance by a variety of methods.   BENEFIT:  Severe crowding of the radio frequency spectrum can be mitigated and bandwidth can be increased to satisfy DOD requirements by utilizing operating frequencies  between 20 – 50 GHz.  Significantly increased data delivery rates and transmission of high resolution imagery can be achieved in tactically useful time to multiple users when operating in the EHF region of the spectrum.  These benefits will be enjoyed in applications such as bandwidth intensive communications and high speed data links imagery intelligence information missile warning systems mapping and geodesy data meteorological and oceanographic data. It is prudent to note Triton ETD design techniques and mechanical configurations are easily adaptable to adjacent frequency bands between 18 – 50 GHz.  Thus as interest in using other regions of the EHF band increase a “tunable” product will already be available. Other potential applications are as follows: Additional near-by bands TWTA and MPM implementations.

The emphasis on Special Operations in recent years has increased the combat range of small units often sending squad-sized units hundreds of miles behind enemy lines. Small units rely on stealth and airpower. They remain covert but when they are discovered they call in airpower to keep from being outgunned. All too often unfortunately air support is not available quickly enough. What is needed is an unmanned weapons platform that can be airborne 24/7 to provide CAS for small units. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop a transformational CAS system that will allow small-unit operators to control unmanned CAS assets from a handheld controller. The soldiers will be able to request unmanned air support target enemy positions and fire the weapons. The soldiers will use a visual control system to guide weapons. A successful Phase I will lead to a Phase II prototype-development program. We will develop a working model of the C-Strike CAS system to validate our approach. Phase III will involve partnering with manufacturers to finalize engineering of the weapons system and to integrate it onto a UAV for flight testing. ","D082-061-0395","SB082-061","08.2",

The proposed miniaturized subsystem will have high data bandwidth (2.5 Gbps) with fast pointing and tracking capability. Adding the fieldable hand held C2 interface (Universal Personal Tracker) for each FSO Transceiver control is proposed to develop a prototype design for a man portable stand-alone complete optical communications terminal system to ultimately be linked to satellites.   The prototype hardware and software for this intelligent broadband optical network is already developed technology that has actually been experimentally demonstrated to military units at the Navy/SOCOM Trident Specter 10 in May 2010. This experiment was limited to ground based use between command center outpost positions and dismounted Warriors. Further design development and analytical projections of fieldable FSO hardware includes suitable mounting hardware plans for airborne (manned and unmanned) units.  Phase II development will include complete fieldable covert communications systems for all military operations except satellites. Further development (in other proposals) extending the existing FSO technology is necessary to add compatible space based communication including space-ground using commensurately upgraded power and lens size for testing long range capability.    BENEFIT:  This proposal is foreseen as a future information network connecting satellites with dismounted Warriors on the ground. Covert communications technology within the US Defense organizations is extremely urgent space-to-space and particularly to the Warriors. Recent incidents of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) radio frequency (RF) mode communications information being compromised in the Afghanistan Theater leads to the requirement for portable port-port optical wideband communication systems.    UIE has a further development plan for miniaturization of the handheld UPT with versions for both military and civilian markets e.g. hunters hikers surveyors etc. (using only civilian hardware).

An ideal test-bed for our approach is the Predator Squadron Operations Center or P-SOC initiative now being developed by the Air Force UAV Battle Lab.  A de facto P-SOC has emerged in every recent Predator deployment to facilitate Predator operations; however this entity has never been fully defined equipped or standardized.  Preliminary P-SOC designs and user interfaces have been proposed by the P-SOC initiative group.  What is critically lacking is the methodology to assess these designs.  Additionally when poor designs are encountered guidance is needed for interface improvements.  Specifically the goal of this SBIR project is to develop an assessment and improvement methodology for P-SOC user interfaces.  Our proposed effort will evaluate assess and recommend improved designs to the current P-SOC operational structure and user interfaces using a cognitive task analysis.  In Phase II the P-SOC operations will be simulated using a synthetic task environment which will serve as a test bed to test and quantify P-SOC performance using various interface designs.  Team-based command and control centers play an increasingly critical role in arenas ranging from air traffic control centers to battlefields to nuclear power plants.  Teams can be made up of members located in close proximity or they can be distributed across great distances.  The growing advances in technology and the resulting complexity of tasks have increased the need for teamwork.  At the same time these demands have increased the cognitive complexity of team tasks.  Team members must interpret situations remember procedures plan make decisions and solve problems as an integrated unit.  As a result effective and efficient team user interfaces training systems and team intervention methodologies to maximize team performance will be a well-defined growth market.","F031-2667","AF03-060","03.1",

Current cooperative control technologies are lacking of learning capability. Without the ability to learn a cooperative system may not be able to react to unanticipated scenarios or adapt to dynamically changing environments in a correct and intelligent fashion and therefore may lead to unsatisfactory system performance or even mission failure. In collaboration with Brigham Young University UtopiaCompression Corporation (UC) proposes a hierarchical learning framework that enables multi-layer learning. A modular learning process is proposed which takes as sensor observations input prior information from offline training mission objectives from higher level and learned information from lower level to facilitate intelligent decision making. To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed framework we propose cooperative control and learning algorithms that learns to gauge the intent of a target using multiple observations and to guide a tracking mission based on the observed behavior of the target in a dynamic environment. The feasibility analysis and the demonstration will illustrate performance improvement and potential benefits of equipping cooperative control technologies with intelligent learning mechanisms.  BENEFIT:  In support of effective operations of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in increasingly complex and uncertain missions the proposed technology will enable UAVs to learn and adapt to the uncertain environment and changes in adversary behavior. The solution will significantly increase the UAV-to-human ratio for successful operation reducing the overall deployment cost. The proposed learning framework will provide a team of UAVs with a set of tools to react effectively to changing environment mission objectives and sensor characteristics. The new capabilities will allow the UAVs to complete the missions while flying safely thus reducing costs due to possible accidents and mission failure.   Within the commercial domain the key technology areas and related applications that can potentially benefit from the proposed technology include surveillance around a critical or secure infrastructure tracking of unknown targets and classifying their behaviors for border security search of targets for rescue or surveillance resupplying UAVs for aircraft carriers Micro Air Vehicles and flying swarms for reconnaissance and remote monitoring and civilian search and rescue. All of these applications require intelligent cooperation and decision making between UAVs which will be enabled through our proposed hierarchical learning framework.     UC has identified numerous product opportunities within the US Military modernization effort centering on implementing C4ISR (Command Control Computers Communication Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance) technologies. ISR spending in the next decade is estimated at $15 billion and depends largely on the stable and efficient control of unmanned vehicles. The UC team is particularly optimistic about the value of integrating UCs technology into the emerging smaller tactical UAVs under development and early deployment such as the RQ-7 and RQ-11 programs. Other potential application programs include the Predator UAV programs as well as multiple FAA compliance efforts currently underway.","F121-002-1380","AF121-002","12.1",

The computational complexities and performance limitations will be better understood by conducting small scale flight tests in collaboration with Brigham Young University.

The use of UAVS is continuously increasing in military as well as civilian domain for applications such as border patrol surveillance fire-fighting agriculture and so on. This increase in the growth of UAVS requires technologies that make them safer to use and robust to failures. The number of redundant system on board the UAVS is restricted due to their limited payload capacity. So enabling technologies for the integrity management of mixed critical unmanned aerial vehicle systems is desired. UC proposes a two-tiered knowledge-based and model-based architecture for fault detection and diagnosis of the on-board sensors. To reduce the false alarm rates the system is also tied to the mission objective. Finally the algorithms developed will be demonstrated for an intruder collision detection and avoidance application.  BENEFIT:  UtopiaCompression’s (UC) system will greatly benefit the Department of Defense (DoD) by enabling UAS especially small UAS to operate in a wider region of the airspace as well as take on more challenging missions. Wider access to the airspace is needed for training security and surveillance and in general to execute missions efficiently. Looking beyond the DoD market the Department of Homeland Security will also benefit from this technology.  They now use the Certificates of Authorization (COA) process to get limited airspace access but this is not viewed as operationally sustainable especially as DHS deploys UAS assets to more challenging venues such as the southwest border.    There is a critical and immediate need for UC’s proposed technology in the broader commercial markets. All military and intelligence divisions within the government will immediately benefit from UC’s technology as they increase automation efforts and integrate UAVs into their avionics programs. In reflection of this trend the avionics systems sector is slated to grow significantly in the next few years. The military avionics market is slated to grow approximately 2.9% annually according to market research analysts Frost and Sullivan. This is expected to account for more than $10.9 billion in expenditures more than half of which will be devoted to upgrades related to transitioning the vehicles into automated information platforms [J05] which will need to be proven airworthy. The technology proposed by UC also enables critical automation capabilities needed by agencies including the FAA DHS Border Patrol NASA and others to meet their missions. In the past year almost a million flights were delayed in the US [CP07]. Within the next 8 years the increasing congestion of the commercial airports will cost the American economy $22 billion a year [CP07]. UC’s proposed technology could be applied to both manned and unmanned control systems to enable 4D trajectory prediction which would decrease congestion and increase commercial TAO safety and efficiency. In particular UC’s technology will be of applicability to the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) planned by the FAA. Approximately $44 billion are expected to be spent on this system [CP07]. In addition a boom in civil aviation communications and automation spending is expected by the end of this decade creating an attractive market opportunity for the proposed technology.  Applications of the proposed technology include increased evaluation capability of integration effects of UAVs into the National Airspace System. The proposed technology will also greatly benefit the NextGen-Airspace project.","F103-008-1321","AF103-008","10.3",

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Regulation states that remotely/autonomously operated aircraft must have an equivalent level of safety comparable to see-and-avoid requirements for manned aircraft to satisfy FAA safety requirements and must exercise due regard for the safety of other aircraft by detecting them and maneuvering to avoid them. UtopiaCompression (UC) innovative automatic cloud detection and avoidance system provides due regard for UAS using the existing EO/IR sensors. The system automatically detects cloud regions against sky and ground in live EO/IR video scenes computes the range from UAS to clouds estimate the size of clouds and performs path planning for UAS to avoid clouds all in real-time. Based on the Phase I successful feasibility study Phase II will continue to finalize the cloud detection/tracking and ranging algorithms optimize the codes to achieve real-time performance and build a complete software prototype. UC will collaborate with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) to integrate the cloud detection algorithms along with existing path planning technology into the NGC existing SAA suite.    BENEFIT:   Unmanned Ariel System (UAS) have become ubiquitous across the Department of Defense.  Major programs such as Global Hawk Reaper Sky Warrior and Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) have formal requirements for UAS to operate routinely in civil airspace.  Accordingly the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) established a Joint Integrated Product Team (JIPT) for UAS Airspace Integration.  This JIPT is charged with developing the technological and regulatory infrastructure needed to secure routine airspace for UAS.  Sense and Avoid (SAA) technology is a critical component of this infrastructure and the JIPT has worked diligently with the services to establish a development and certification roadmap for SAA. The intelligent cloud detection and avoidance algorithms provide a key capability component for EO/IR due regard technology for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) including the Global Hawk weapon system.  UC maintains that the cloud detection and avoidance system solution is a quantum leap advance in state-of-the-art of autonomous navigation with “due regard” for the safety of other airspace users. Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) flight crews often deviate from their filed IFR (instrument flight rules) flight plans during the course of their missions.  Regulations permit this provided the pilots operate with “due regard” for the safety of other airspace users.  Human ISR pilots provide “due regard…” by remaining in VMC (visual meteorological conditions) and conducting routine VFR (visual flight rules) operations; in other words they perform the SAA function. The technology developed will be integrated and transitioned through the Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) process to Global Hawk thereby providing full Due Regard operation using EO/IR sensors (cloud detection ranging and avoidance) to keep the UAS in VMC so the existing SAA capability can function as designed.  UC has teamed with the prime contractor Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) to transition EO/IR Due Regard technology to the Global Hawk Program by inserting the technology into the existing SAA transition plan now being ably executed by NGC. The UC team will maximize the likelihood of successful transition by working closely with Government stakeholders throughout the Phase II process. The largest catalyst for growth in the UAS sector has been and for the next few years will continue to be the government’s trend toward information warfare and net-centric systems. UC team understands that the first application of the technology is for the Global Hawk and other military UAS. A senior analyst with the market research company Teal Group Steve Zaloga identified unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a “key element in the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) portion” of this trend with expansions into other missions expected as well with the advent of hunter-killer UAVs.  Worldwide UAV expenditures are expected to more than triple over the next decade from $2.7 billion annually to $8.3 billion.  U.S. defense spending on UAVs is projected to increase more than two-fold in the next decade from $2 billion annually to $4.5 billion. Analysts anticipate that a civil market for UAVs will emerge more slowly over the next decade beginning with government organizations with missions and needs similar to military UAVs such as coast guards border patrol organizations and similar national security organizations. Beyond military applications the UC team believes that critical traction is being gained through the efforts of this SBIR program in a primary market with broad economic potential – the UAV market. The combination of UC’s passive ranging (without the need to maneuver) and the cloud detection and avoidance technologies will provide far superior SAA capabilities for UAVs than that which is currently available. This is an important enabling technology because despite a large degree of interest in UAVs for a multitude of governmental and commercial purposes adoption has been slow due to a number of technological and regulatory barriers. One of the most important remaining regulatory and technological barrier to broader adoption of UAVs both in government and commercial venues is the certification of a system of technology feedback analysis and control which can reduce the risk of air to air collision down to that of a manned flight. The technology developed by UC for this SBIR program constitutes a critical enabling technology for removing this barrier. The UC team envisions adapting the resultant technology for ground applications in the future including Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and OEM automotive electronics applications such as adaptive cruise control (ACC) collision warning and headway control - a lucrative market that reached a size of $810 million in 2007. UC team intend to sell the technology developed in Phases I II and beyond in one or more of the following ways:  (1) License to OEM/reseller (2) Form joint venture/partnership to sell solutions where these core technologies will need to be integrated into the solutions (3) Subcontract to other OEMs or system integrators offering consulting services to integrate technology into a specific system or platform.  UC and DEC are collaborating to develop options (1) (2) and (3) and will partner with additional or other integrators to provide the right solution.    UC team is determined to demonstrate success with the Air Force as an initial customer and expand to other service branches and agencies.  During phase II development and beyond the UC team will work closely with the Air Force Research Laboratory Air Force Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) and SAA prime contractor NGC to transition the technology.","F2-4860","AF081-087","08.1",

Currently the lack of Sense and Avoid (SAA) technology is the largest obstacle to this capability.  The SAA problem is all the more challenging when dealing with non-cooperative traffic. For this problem it is increasingly becoming clear that a suite of sensors is the solution. Electro-optical (EO) sensors are attractive because of their size weight and power (SWaP) characteristics. However range estimation using EO sensors has in general some degree of inaccuracy associated with it. Radars can be used to complement them but they may not meet the SWaP constraints of smaller UAS. A well-designed ladar has the potential to efficiently complement EO SAA technologies. In this proposal UtopiaCompression in collaboration with SAIC and University of Dayton is proposing a novel ladar technology solution for UAS which will be optimized to work with passive EO sensors. Apart from providing accurate range estimates to intruder aircraft the solution will also have fewer false alarms as compared to the passive only solution. The technology will be developed in such a way so as to be compatible with Air Force Research Laboratory’s existing SAA simulation facilities.  BENEFIT:  UtopiaCompression’s (UC) system will greatly benefit the Air Force and in general the Department of Defense (DoD) by enabling UAS to operate in a wider region of the airspace as well as take on more challenging missions.

They now use the Certificates of Authorization (COA) process to get limited airspace access but this is not viewed as operationally sustainable especially as DHS deploys UAS assets to more challenging venues such as the southwest border.   As its effectiveness in avoiding collisions is demonstrated UC anticipates a move in the commercial aviation industry to adopt the technology as a pilot advisory system.  This is similar to what happened with T-CAS (Traffic – Collision Avoidance System) a cooperative system for avoiding collisions based on exchanging data through transponder signals.  T-CAS was conceived as an autonomous technology but eventually adopted as an advisory system because the pilot in command is ultimately responsible for seeing and avoiding traffic as he executes maneuvers.  All revenue traffic (airliners etc) now carry T-CAS.  Similarly SAA technology which can detect non-cooperative traffic over a much larger volume of sky than a human and is never distracted will improve pilot situation awareness and therefore flight safely.  As economies of scale bring the price down to the T-CAS range and test data begin to demonstrate flight safety improvements it seems reasonable to expect the FAA and commercial aviation entities will adopt technology. SAIC will support the transition effort for SAA Ladar technology.  SAIC is well-positioned to bring the ladar technology to a level of maturity where it will be of interest to UAS program offices and prime contractors. Additionally as UC has formal business relationship and collaborative arrangement for other SAA technologies with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) UC will work with NGC to transition the proposed Sense and Avoid Ladar for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles technology to the UAS programs by inserting the technology into the existing SAA transition plan now being ably executed by NGC.

A well-designed ladar has the potential to efficiently complement EO/IR SAA technologies. During Phase I UtopiaCompression in collaboration with SAIC and University of Dayton designed a novel SAA ladar solution for RPA to complement passive EO/IR sensing. The design feasibility has been shown through high fidelity ladar sub-system as well as integrated system level modeling and simulations. In addition to accurate ranging to intruders the ladar can also be used to reduce the false alarm rate of passive EO/IR solutions. Phase II will focus on further design optimizations and prototype development.  BENEFIT:  UtopiaCompression’s (UC) system will greatly benefit the Air Force and in general the Department of Defense (DoD) by enabling RPA to operate in a wider region of the airspace as well as take on more challenging missions. Wider access to the airspace is needed for training security and surveillance and in general to execute missions efficiently. Looking beyond the DoD market the Department of Homeland Security will also benefit from this technology.  They now use the Certificates of Authorization (COA) process to get limited airspace access but this is not viewed as operationally sustainable especially as DHS deploys RPA assets to more challenging venues such as the southwest border.    As its effectiveness in avoiding collisions is demonstrated UC anticipates a move in the commercial aviation industry to adopt the technology as a pilot advisory system.  This is similar to what happened with T-CAS (Traffic – Collision Avoidance System) a cooperative system for avoiding collisions based on exchanging data through transponder signals.  T-CAS was conceived as an autonomous technology but eventually adopted as an advisory system because the pilot in command is ultimately responsible for seeing and avoiding traffic as he executes maneuvers.  All revenue traffic (airliners etc) now carry T-CAS.  Similarly SAA technology which can detect non-cooperative traffic over a much larger volume of sky than a human and is never distracted will improve pilot situation awareness and therefore flight safely.  As economies of scale bring the price down to the T-CAS range and test data begin to demonstrate flight safety improvements it seems reasonable to expect the FAA and commercial aviation entities will adopt technology.  SAIC will support the transition effort for SAA Ladar technology.  SAIC is well-positioned to bring the ladar technology to a level of maturity where it will be of interest to RPA program offices and prime contractors. Additionally as UC has formal business relationship and collaborative arrangement for other SAA technologies with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) UC will work with NGC to transition the proposed Sense and Avoid Ladar for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles technology to the RPA programs by inserting the technology into the existing SAA transition plan now being ably executed by NGC. The UC team will maximize the likelihood of successful transition by working closely with Government stakeholders throughout the Program process.    The largest catalyst for growth in the RPA sector has been and for the next few years will continue to be the government’s trend toward information warfare and net-centric systems. A senior analyst with the market research company Teal Group Steve Zaloga identified RPA as a “key element in the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) portion” of this trend with expansions into other missions expected as well with the advent of hunter-killer RPA.  Worldwide RPA expenditures are expected to more than triple over the next decade from $2.7 billion annually to $8.3 billion.  U.S. defense spending on RPA is projected to increase more than two-fold in the next decade from $2 billion annually to $4.5 billion. Analysts anticipate that a civil market for UAVs will emerge more slowly over the next decade beginning with government organizations with missions and needs similar to military RPA such as coast guards border patrol organizations and similar national security organizations.    Beyond military applications the UC team believes that critical traction is being gained through the efforts of this SBIR program in a primary market with broad economic potential – the RPA market. The combination of UC’s Sense and Avoid Ladar passive ranging (without the need to maneuver) and the cloud detection and avoidance technologies will provide far superior SAA capabilities for RPA than that which is currently available. This is an important enabling technology because despite a large degree of interest in RPA for a multitude of governmental and commercial purposes adoption has been slow due to a number of technological and regulatory barriers. One of the most important remaining regulatory and technological barrier to broader adoption of RPA both in government and commercial venues is the certification of a system of technology feedback analysis and control which can reduce the risk of air to air collision down to that of a manned flight. The technology developed by UC for this SBIR program constitutes a critical enabling technology for removing this barrier. The UC team envisions adapting the resultant technology for ground applications in the future including Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and OEM automotive electronics applications such as adaptive cruise control (ACC) collision warning and headway control - a lucrative market that reached a size of $810 million in 2007.    UC team is determined to demonstrate success with the Air Force as an initial customer and expand to other service branches and agencies.  During Phase I phase II development and beyond the UC team will work closely with the Air Force Research Laboratory Air Force Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) and SAA prime contractors to transition the technology.","F2-5784","AF093-136","09.3",

Compared to older bent pipe satellite systems with no onboard IP routing and processing schemes the newer generations offer a lot more flexibility. Accordingly the impact of cross-layer approaches and joint optimization of routing and transport protocols need to be investigated for heterogeneous GEOstationary (GEO) + Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks.  To respond to this challenge we propose Joint Transport and Routing Optimization for Adaptive Satellite Networks (JTRO-ASN). This powerful framework intends to boost network usage and to improve end to end performances over satellite channels. JTRO-ASN sense and exploit network and transport parameters using adaptive schemes to enable the protocol stack to maximize system efficiency. The aforementioned cooperative mechanism by bypassing the strict OSI layer boundaries facilitates dynamic information distribution and exploitation where it is needed.  JTRO-ASN can handle diverse aggressive space channel conditions employing adaptive protocols customized for satellite networks applications. A cross-layer technique grants the stack layers to share relevant information to facilitate exploitation of the data. JTRO-ASN improves overall network throughput and latency. For a given domain additional flows are supported simultaneously over several links. Furthermore JTRO-ASN delivers enhanced reliability robustness and scalability in dynamic network situations. The JTRO-ASN methodology is an ideal choice to provide the most favorable route the finest transport protocol tuning and the best possible link management in harsh space conditions.  BENEFIT:  In order to meet the modern military mission critical operation requirements secure high bandwidth for a large number of heterogeneous war-fighting users is required. UC’s proposed IP-based satellite network architecture will greatly benefit the Air Force’s satellite communication programs by enabling the linkage of user preferences and network conditions and significantly reducing both latency between network nodes and transmission failures among other identified objectives. UC’s technologies will greatly enhance communications at the tactical edges increasing mission efficiency and effectiveness and enhancing Air Force program objectives overall. Moreover an enhanced and effective broadband satellite communications system is a critical component of the DoD’s force transformation to a network centric state.  Defense: Key Structural changes outlined in the U.S. DoD’s FY 2011 budget will increase demand for secure broadband satellite communications through increases in targeted personnel such as Special Forces as well transformation of Army Multi-functional and Functional Support (MFF) brigades to a modular design [K11]. Enhanced satellite capabilities will under the future paradigm be driven down through the brigade to the company level. The growth rate of the military satellite communications sector is projected at 5.6 percent annual growth over the next ten years dependent on the advent of critical enabling technologies like what UC proposes here [F10]. Current DoD programs which would benefit from UC’s enabling satellite communications technologies include numerous ISR programs which will require significantly increased and reliable communications capabilities to deliver performance projections as well as the UAVs which carry the ISR payloads and communicate with other mobile machines. Specific programs include the Global Hawk vehicles and the upgraded Predator drone Gray Eagle. Transition opportunities for the proposed technologies exist within the Wideband Global SATCOM Deployment (currently consisting of 6 satellites $182 million was recently authorized to start work on a seventh satellite with as many as 12 WGS satellites in the projected pipeline).  UC is determined to demonstrate success with the Air Force as its initial customer and then expand its product offering to other service branches and agencies. To ensure a successful transition of the technology UC’s strategy includes partnering with Lockheed Martin Space Systems during Phases I and Phase II to facilitate efficient development and transition of the technology into their ongoing programs. UC will also pursue contacts within Cisco Systems Inc. and Intelsat General Corp. to follow up on their capabilities demonstrations and evaluate collaboration opportunities.  Commercial Applications: The commercial potential for the proposed technology is significant and slated to grow substantially. Satellites worth a total of $250 billion should be launched over the course of the next 15 years with 1600 satellites by 2025 [NSR11]. Drivers for this growth include GEO ComSat replacement government contracts Science and Navigation missions and the Ka-band/HTS “me too” syndrome [NSR11]. UC’s proposed routing technologies will be critical enabling components in support of this growth. UC’s proposed technologies will also provide critical capabilities to the commercial Mobile Satellite Services market which relies on reliable connection between heterogeneous mobile devices. The global MSS market will grow to $10.2 billion in 2020 more than doubling from today’s volume [NS11]. The world Satellite Machine-to-Machine communications sector of MSS supports applications used for logistical tracking telemetry remote monitoring geo fencing security and scientific monitoring providing various benefits for industries ranging from agriculture to retail. This sector is strongly dominated by the United States which holds 62 percent market share and its revenue is estimated to reach $1.9 billion by 2016 [D10]. UC will analyze optimal transition plans and entry points within this value chain over the course of Phases I and II to effectively maximize the commercial potential of the proposed technology.  Commercial Transition: During Phase I UC will conduct research to identify optimal product insertion points and will address key market questions to establish the commercial viability of the proposed technology and establish the right relationships to develop the technology for the commercial markets. UC will identify additional potential vendors and partners and engage in discussions with them and their key suppliers and partners to ensure timely and cost-effective distribution of the proposed technology. UC will establish an ongoing dialogue with program managers of divisions through which transition of the technology is anticipated and contracting partners to identify user requirements and facilitate a seamless technical and commercial transition in Phase II and beyond. UC will also leverage its existing relationships with Program Managers within the Air Force and Lockheed Martin to gather user requirements and establish testing protocols early facilitating a more efficient transition into the marketplace.  UC intends to market the technology developed in Phases I & II in one or more of the following ways: 1) Partnering. Under this approach UC will partner with hardware manufacturers and system integrators to develop and market UC’s routing technologies as components of satellite payloads and communication hardware systems with expanded functionality. Of primary interest to UC are prime contractors and major providers of communications technology to Defense such as partner Lockheed Martin with whom UC has a long-term partnering relationship. 2) Direct licensing. UC’s technologies will also be directly licensed to satellite services providers and satellite mobile devices interested in integrating them into their communication hardware systems or platforms. 3) Services. In conjunction with the above approaches UC will offer customized services to develop solutions tailored to customer needs in particular industries or research areas based on UC’s superior understanding of the routing architectures and related components and algorithms.","F11B-T12-0171","AF11-BT12","11.B",

Current UGV operator control units (OCUs) lag behind advances in unmanned vehicle technologies and remain bulky heavy unintuitive and power-hungry. Additionally these systems are "stovepiped" in that they are developed for only a particular mission and a single robot significantly restricting flexible use of robots across a variety of missions.  Vecna Technologies Inc. proposes the development of an advanced mobile OCU that leverages the built-in sensors and flexible hardware of  hand-held devices such as smartphones running Google's Android platform. Instead of mapping control scheme to unintuitive buttons control will be multimodal. For example driving control will utilize the built in accelerometers to enable control similar to that of the Nintendo Wii.  Waypoint navigation will use the built in GPS localization and built in camera to designate target locations.  Gesture based controls that also use the accelerometers will enable hands-free commands. Vecna's OCU being primarily software based will be applicable to a large range of missions through its modular design; if additional capabilities for command modules are needed the operator can receive updates in the field or add more control modules. Intelligence and context information will be shared not just between operators but with mission planners far from the battlefield enabling cohesive shared situational awareness.

If the tracks are widely separated then the association decisions can be relatively easy.

Specific goals include the development of new manufacturing processes that reliably produce high throughput (>80%) low beam distortion (M2 < 1.5) on cm sized apertures (a round 1 cm beam input and output) low cost wide-angle (>50o) and low SWaP scanners. In phase I we will experimentally validate new manufacturing processes for high yield production of devices with the required performance attributes. We will also deliver at the end of phase I a prototype EO scanner system. In phase II we will increase the TRL and demonstrate EO scanner operation in a relevant military environment.","N111-039-1602","N111-039","11.1",

These new devices are enabled by the combined development of revolutionary non-mechanical beamsteerers by Vescent and state-of-the-art optical telecommunications technology.  The proposed systems will be entirely electro-optic provide unprecedented size weight and power and be able to scan an entire wide angle (>90o) field of view (FOV) in less than a millisecond with analog resolution. This system will be designed to meet future persistent surveillance and situational awareness needs wherein high definition video capabilities are being extended to a greater number of mobile tactical platforms e.g. MAVs UAVs etc. and relay this Airborne Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) to a GEO satellite or other ground or flight platform.  Our approach circumvents the challenges of opto-mechanical scanners by utilizing new EO scanner technology which will transmit high bandwidth optical signals to a target; a low bandwidth RF signal can be used to lock the transmit scanner to the target thereby maintaining data-link integrity as the platforms move relative to one another.

For an Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) this problem creates a safety risk in situations where the landing site is in close proximity to terrain structures.  A partial solution is to use multiple antennas on the vehicle.  However transmitting from multiple antennas results in the reception of multiple signals that can be interfering or constructive.  A new approach applying Per-Survivor-Processing (PSP) offers the opportunity to achieve dramatic performance improvements (e.g. increased range).   PSP excels when the channel characteristics the number of multipaths interferers and other key signal parameters are unknown.  Application of PSP to wideband real-time stereo video is now feasible due to the rapidly increasing computational power and decreasing price of modern digital technology.  PSP algorithms have been developed and simulated for dense urban and rural environments with mobile users under other efforts.

However most current payloads have unique electronic interfaces rendering reconfiguration or swapping of new/modified payloads to SUASs a costly process. To address this problem VIPMobile proposes the development of a standard payload interface (SPI) in the form of an SUAS ISR Micro-Payload Interface Master Module (PIMM) a technology based on a previous VIPMobile system. The SPI solution identifies relevant sensors munitions and other payload components for SUAS and provides flexible and scalable interconnection between the SUAS and payloads. Cross queuing of sensor data and digital communication between payload components is standardized through XML-derived the Cursor-on-Target machine language. The Micro-PIMM will have a ground control segment granting on-the-ground CCT operatives access to avionics firing and override solutions. The overall system will enable end users to efficiently and cost effectively plug and play various ISR payloads into SUASs without swapping out or reconfiguring the entire payload from mission to mission.  BENEFIT:  The SUAS ISR Micro-PIMM overcomes typical SUAS-payload incompatibility and enables efficient and cost-effective plug and play of various ISR payloads into SUASs without swapping out or reconfiguring the entire payload from mission to mission. It also allows on-the-ground Combat Control Teams tactical access to and control of the avionics/payloads and sensor data of the SUAS. Commercially there is a rising demand for UAVs and accompanying technology especially with respect to SUAS. Potential application of the Micro-PIMM can be extended to larger UAV systems (perhaps to all unmanned vehicles) and to other (DoD) departments and branches such as Customs CNTPO Army and Homeland Defense. The Micro-PIMM can be delivered as a “Tactical ISR Package” to current end users of VIPMobile solutions such as CAG JSOC. The package would consist of a UAV equipped with the Micro-PIMM an EICT Field Computing Device for the most forward deployed Combat Control Teams (CCT)  that communicates with the Micro-PIMM and an ATC Tactical Briefcase that interacts with both the PIMM in the air and the EICT on the ground.","F103-170-0042","AF103-170","10.3",

COMPACT produces a pulsed jet by the ignition of a mixture of fuel and oxidizer in a miniature (cm3-scale) combustion chamber.  The combustion creates a rapid pressure rise in the chamber and the subsequent ejection of a high-speed jet through a single or multiple orifices.  Chamber pressures up to 5 atm have been achieved in prototype devices and yielded sonic orifice velocities and high jet momentum coefficients suitable for aerodynamic flow control (shock control separation drag reduction etc.) at transonic or supersonic speeds.  Reactants flow into the chamber is regulated by passive fluidic valves such that COMPACT operates without moving parts and presents minimal infrastructure requirements. Liquid fuel COMPACT arrays that are batch-fabricated lightweight with integrated plumbing and electronics can be realized and are the focus of the proposed STTR research.  The proposed work will characterize and optimize the performance of COMPACT actuators that are driven by liquid fuel (using atomization or fuel reforming) and will include the development of high-volume MEMS-based batch fabrication approaches.  COMPACT performance will be demonstrated in two transonic wind tunnel tests to be performed by the Boeing Company.  The ability of combustion-powered actuators (COMPACT) to control aerodynamic flows at transonic and supersonic speeds has the potential to dramatically alter the flight envelope of commercial and military aircraft.  It is envisioned that the first application of COMPACT to flight platforms will be demonstrated by Boeing in transonic wind tunnel test of drag reduction with potential future implementation in high-speed high-maneuverability transonic aircraft.  It is anticipated that the total fuel (same as for engines) consumption by COMPACT actuation will be very low compared to other energy expenditures during flight.   Initially discrete COMPACT arrays will be used to augment conventional control surfaces and later designs may become fully distributed to optimize control authority over the entire wing potentially replacing conventional control surfaces.  It is likely that initial flight demonstration will take place on UAV-class aircraft and once reliability is proven adoption would next occur in manned military aircraft.  Eventually this mode of actuation may find use on commercial aircraft.  The ultimate vision of the company is to develop and commercialize jet actuators that are more efficient and cost-effective than conventional control surfaces.  Commercialization of the technology will proceed down two paths.  The first path will involve selling COMPACT devices to researchers in the fluid mechanics aerodynamics and MEMS scientific communities.  A large market exists for small high-control-authority actuators for a variety of scientific experiments; e.g. aerodynamic control on lifting surfaces control of internal flows in ducts fluidic-based mechanical actuation (e.g. exoskeletons and robotics) etc.  The second path will build on the substantial interest that The Boeing Company has shown in implementing this actuation technology in military and commercial platforms.

The core of EPAS consists of four different non-acoustic detection technologies integrated into a single system.  EPAS components are: (1) a 12-channel visible multi-spectral imager (2) a three-channel low-light-level spectral detector (3) a three-channel low-light zoomed camera and (4) a mid-wave (3-5 micron) infrared (IR) detector.  Currently the EPAS multi-spectral imager does not take advantage of polarization or handle the negative effects of sea surface foam on system imaging performance.  Significant reduction of false alarms and enhancement of the probability of detection are expected if these effects are understood.  Twelve individual cameras are used to collect the visible multi-spectral data.  The proposed effort will develop the understanding of these effects needed to evaluate the achievable performance benefits.  Sensor polarizer options and data processing algorithms will be developed that will potentially result in a new smaller system with optimized beam splitting.   BENEFITS: Improved performance and reduction in the size of the multispectral imaging system will lead to an opportunity to transition the developed product directly to the EPAS program during its acquisition cycle.  There is also the potential for transition to other air platforms such as multi-mission aircraft (MMA) such as the P-8A and the H-60.  Also of considerable potential is possible miniaturization to facilitate system installation on smaller unmanned air vehicles (UAVs).

We seek to investigate whether or not the local flow upstream of a sensor intake manifold on an UAV can be manipulated to increase the effective sampling volume. The project reflects the common occurrence of substantial turbulent and vortical fields associated with UAV's that may potentially be used to effectively redirect airborne particulates toward sensor intake locations. A revolutionary gridfree computational approach pioneered by VorCat Inc. will be used to effect an accurate numerical simulation of the unsteady turbulent field associated with a UAV traversing a particle-laden atmosphere.  A number of possible options for augmenting the range of particles brought to a sensor during UAV flight will be considered.

Because the performance of auto-pilots and video trackers is limited by SRPA system constraints the vehicle state errors will likely lead to low target estimation precision. As the taggant delivery efficiency falls off with distance and operational viability of optical taggants depends upon depositing nanoparticles in specific spectral mixtures and at precise target locations increased precision is required for this application especially at the long standoff ranges required for covert delivery. Toward this end fixed- and gimbal-mounted day/night sensor systems will be characterized augmented with auxillary sensors and off-board data and integrated with the SUAS’ navigation system. After determining the target estimation accuracy taggant dissemination systems will be developed and an integrated delivery payload will be first tested on zip lines and then in flight field tests. The information gained from these tests will be used to develop an optimized small sized light weight SRPA-based taggant delivery payload which will be validated in military sponsored flight tests.  BENEFIT:  The military interests discussed in the Defense Science Board’s 2004 study entitled Transition to and from Hostilities recommends a “Manhattan Project-like” focus to develop extensive covert tagging tracking and locating (TTL) technology. Using optically encoded taggants a powerful new tool addresses the challenges resulting from unconventional war targets and technical advances in military weaponry and applies the Defense Science Board’s recommendations. Optical taggants also satisfy the military’s need for combat identification (CI) and identification of friend or foe (IFF). Commercial markets include anti-counterfeiting and high Value Document Authentication.","F2-6683","AF112-002","11.2",

The technical problem is very challenging especially for that on UAVs because of the constraints on antenna size and form factor by the platform and since the gain-bandwidth of an antenna is fundamentally limited by the antenna’s physical size in wavelength at FM and TV frequencies. Therefore USSOCOM conducted a phase-I effort in support of PGR (PSYOP Global Reach) ACTD (Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration). Wang Electro-Opto Corporation (WEO) as one of three companies chosen to perform phase-I research was selected to move forward toward Phase-II. The Phase-II objectives are to support the LRBS (Long Range Broadcast System) payload development effort in the PGR program. WEO’s proposed technical approach is based on its unique broadband low-profile conformable Spiral-Mode Microstrip (SMM) antenna technology. While the feasibility of this technical approach has been demonstrated in Phase-I using frequency-scaled breadboard models Phase-II research must deal with effects of the pod and the antenna EMC/EMI issues.

The test and training communities have seen a twenty fold increase in the telemetry data rates over the past 10 years.  When this increase in need is coupled with the reduction in available spectrum caused by the sell-off of government spectrum the combination creates a major test and training cost and schedule impact to major weapons system programs.  Advances in technology may make the application of directional antennas to telemetry practical.  WEO proposes to develop an affordable directional airborne telemetry antenna to functionally replace existing omni-directional antennas on a variety of test vehicles.  The approach is based mainly on a helmet-mounted beam-steered array WEO recently developed for the US Army which represents the first affordable battery-operated smart array antenna.  With respect to geolocation and adaptive beam control the proposed research will also draw heavily from WEO's 3-year experience in developing an ultra-wideband photonically-controlled phased array.  This beam-steered array antenna will allow the ranges to support more missions without additional spectrum by letting multiple telemetry users to operate on the same frequency on the same range with different acquisition antennas. Small directional antennas could potentially revolutionize the commercial communications industry.  Initial commercial applications include commercial airliners freight companies and telecommunications companies (proposing the use of UAVs and LEO satellites as data relays).","F001-0383","AF00-294","00.1",

To develop antennas to cover each band individually is not too difficult technically but would lead to an operational nightmare since many antennas are needed to cover all the bands.

Wang Electro-Opto (WEO) has unique enabling and well-established broadband conformable antenna technologies and proposes to develop a single-aperture antenna system that can operate in all FM and TV bands. The proposed antenna can be conformally mounted on a platform with a mounting surface area of about 3 ft. x 3 ft. It is capable of good polarization match with all ground receive antennas not possible by other approaches.

To help Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams locate and extract UXO Williams-Pyro Inc. is developing the Dynamic Remote Ordnance Identification and Detection (DROID) system which comprises rugged secure and low-power active RFID tags and portable tag readers. Tags are affixed to ordnance before deployment and the tag reader which supports UAV handheld or wheeled vehicle deployment is flown/driven in a search pattern to locate the ordnance. Specialized algorithms use data collected from the tag reader to accurately determine the location of the UXO from ranges of up to 100 meters while the ordnance is buried up to 10 feet in the ground. The key technologies being developed during this effort include a survivable tagging technology and ordnance attachment method for the MK-80 series bombs to survive the extreme impact forces accurate UXO location algorithms and UXO location logging software. In Phase I we proved the feasibility of this technology and in Phase II we plan to create a rugged prototype and evaluate its performance in a realistic environment.  BENEFIT:  The issue with existing technologies is they employ sensors that must cover nearly every square inch of land. In addition studies indicate that as few as 10% of UXO located using methods based on magnetic technology are actually UXO and not false readings. Williams-Pyro’s proposed technology will greatly improve the speed and accuracy at which an area can be cleared of UXO while offering significant cost reduction. Our long-range tagging technology will allow much larger regions to be searched in much shorter times. Using our tag-based technology where a tag is attached to the bomb body and remains with the bomb false detections are nearly if not completely eliminated. This technology is also applicable to training facilities for clearing live or intentionally inert bombs dropped during training exercises. More area will be searched in the same time and at lower cost speeding remediation and making it safer for people living near these areas as well as protecting the environment. Additional military applications include locating land mines and retrieving unattended ground sensors.

The proposal will identify suitable sensor payloads that can be integrated to the platform to fulfill the MDA's primary mission objective of observing and recording boost phase ballistic missile launches. Such missions will further the understanding of boost phase launches enabling the design of detection and intercept methods that will directly contribute to the defense of the United States its troops and allies. Phase I will be accomplished in house utilizing design tools and tests that have been proven through Aeros' previous projects including the FAA certification of its Aeros 40B airship and prototype stratospheric airship production.

WWTG’s innovations in this project will benefit the Air Force (and other DoD branches) by providing:  1)  A tool-assisted design strategies for composing mixed critical system architectures based on Aspect Containment Regions (ACRs) mapped onto system partitions 2) A middleware service that will assist and enforce the ACR mappings 3) a means for non-invasive run-time diagnosis for detecting violations. A companion tool suite is used for analysis and certification using a model-based approach. In analyzing mixed critical architectures we utilize a component-based analysis approach centering on the representation of system security safety dependability and certification aspects within a comprehensive system architecture model.  The process and tool can be used to reduce overall recertification costs while maintaining the required security dependability safety and real-time performance properties across the complete system life cycle.     BENEFIT:  Our approach contains many benefits when employed on complex high failure consequence systems that address system security dependability safety and life cycle cost.  The key benefit that our technology provides is reduced system build/certification costs while maintaining high levels of system security reliability and safety.  By integrating system certification process sensitivities with system architectural models the cost drivers in the certification process are exposed and can be actively considered with other traditional design trade-offs.  This leads to more cost effective initial designs and upgrades of existing systems.  The integration of attributes for dependability and safety provide addition benefits; enabling early detection of reliability issues or potential safety violations which in turn leads to deployed systems that are more robust and have lower cost due to elimination of expensive rework late in the development cycle.     The benefits can be applied to any domain that relies on information flow and requires verification and certification of aspects for security dependability and safety. Foremost among these domains are DoD MILS/S aircraft ship control C4I grid computing weapons systems and information security systems.","F093-005-2335","AF093-005","09.3",

In this program XCOM and OSU team up to design Ka-band MEM phase shifters and ESA subarrays using piezoelectric meta-materials being commercialized under a U.S. Army CRADA.  The team will begin by assessing existing 20-22 GHz phase shifter and arrays meta-material tuning element and chip-scale packaging to identify risk elements although no incompatibilities of element frequency bandwidth reliability lifetime size loss or isolation are evident.  Modeling may achieve a preliminary phase shifter design capable of hitting all Phase II target specifications with a question being in the adaptability of the meta-tuner to adapt/flatten response across the band and the effects of high transmit power on tuning.  These are critical technologies to support and questions to answer as the availability of qualified RF MEMS components can lead to the rapid success of government and commercial systems with higher performance than previously possible.  BENEFIT:  If successful these technologies could be used in Government electronically steerable antennas for radar and tactical radio systems radar and communications test sets cellular wireless infrastructure and ultimately even consumer devices.  The direct benefits to the Department of Defense from supporting this effort include the laboratory testing of small-form electronically steered tactical radio systems within the timeline of the Phase II effort and environment-equivalent controlled range testing within 1 year after.  Phase III field testing and qualified production can begin within two years after the Phase II effort as most UAV and communications prime contractors are already familiar with XCOM MEMS products and ESA benefits.  Additional benefits will be realized down-stream using these technologies in reconfigurable radar and communication systems with forward-compatible system architectures to complement software-defined waveforms and adaptive EW systems with greater tunability.  These technologies accomplish power savings while improving sensitivity data link quality and EW resilience at reduced cost and component count.  The greatest commercial benefits are substantial energy savings in cellular infrastructure reducing carbon footprint; an estimated 10 million tons of CO2 can be eliminated within 5 years of the completion of  Phase II.   Total addressable markets in 2013 for these technologies are projected at $1.4 billion across Government and civilian applications.

With the guidance/nose cone section unaltered the wing/tails fit conformally to the ERGM projectile skin structure with minimum impact to the remaining internal volume.  The improved performance include: (a) large increase in the volume and warhead payload (b) extended range; (c) increased mission flexibility by enhanced maneuverability; (d) reduced flight time; and (e) cost reduction.  The proposed approach is to merge the outstanding aerodynamic characteristics of the oblique-wing/tails with smart structures for twist/camber control to achieve optimal lift-to-drag ratios throughout flight and enhanced maneuverability by adding direct lift control.

Thus the CKEM can be controlled effectively in hypersonic/supersonic flight without any control canards.  Nor would it require mechanical actuation for hinged bent-nose control.  Hence the merit of the body-flexure PZT control CKEM design lies in its being a simpler system but with reduced weight and enhanced maneuverability.    The proof-of-concept study is overwhelmingly positive in favor of PZT-actuated body flexure control design concept.  A low-power PZT control system is proven feasible for trim and high-G maneuver control of hypervelocity CKEM configurations.  While maintaining stability the CKEM smart-actuation control forces and moments can be amplified by the aeroelastic effects of an optimum aeroelastically-tailored composite structure using ASTROS* optimization.  ASTROS* can also optimize sensor and PZT locations which are necessary to achieve an ultimately effective control system design.    ZONA intends to work closely with the MRDEC R&D personnel and system developers for the continuing staged-CKEM development.  The phase I outcome will be a minimum weight structure and a minimum-power integrated control system design that satisfies given performance requirements.

In this effort we will first identify the pros and cons of a discrete Unsteady Euler Adjoint Solver (UEAS) against a continuous UEAS. Then the selected UEAS will be coupled with a reduced-order structural adjoint solver to demonstrate the capability of the coupled unsteady adjoint solver in handling challenging cases including non-autonomous systems with very long time scales and systems exhibiting periodic and non-periodic limit cycle oscillations. This effort can remove all the technical obstacles involved in the development of the 2D UASA methodology and pave the way for its 3D extension in Phase II.

The remote runway survey includes 4 steps (or the survey system consists of 4 subsystems).          In the first step we will use Remote Sensing Pictures (RSP) from satellite and airplane to roughly determine which area is suitable for runway. In the second step we will use Micropower Impulse Imaging Radar (MIIR) from a surveillance airplane unmaned aerial vehicle or helicopter to penetrate the ground and roughly get the structure of different layers of the ground selected by the first step. In the third step we will use parachute or rope to drop a specially designed robot from helicopter or integrate the robot with UAV together to take the soil samples of different layers using a modified Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) without making a big borehole. The small robot will equip all necessary measurement instruments including spectrometer laser induced fluorescence GPS inclinometer compass imagery sensor and traverse the whole assault zone quietly to measure the soil characteristics calculate load bearing capacity for large military aircraft and measure the physical dimensions of the assault zone including property slope and magnetic orientation. All of the data/images will be wireless sent to the remote site at least 3 miles away using our gum-size transmitter even sent 100 miles away through our recently developed personal satellite communication system. The last step is to analyze the data/images from RSP MIIR DCP and LIF at the remote site and compare the standard data/images to get a correct conclusion. In phase I a laboratory prototype will be delivered to SOCOM for demonstration.       The new runway survey system could be used in a broad range of military and civilian applications where load bearing capabilities of soil and surface slope are important. Airport road and building construction projects could benefit immediately from this capability. The related cutting edge technologies: remote sensing Robot MIIR DCP LIF wireless communication and image classification also will find large military and commercial applications.
